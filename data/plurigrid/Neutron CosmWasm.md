## Benefits for Neutron
Growing interdependence and range of applications of IBC technology to extend into critcal infrastructure public goods bootstrapping, 
# Legend

Neutron is the first implementation of Interchain Security backed by $ATOM for a permissionless CosmWasm chain; the first and the largest permissionless CosmWasm chain (no gov vote for contract upload) is Jun√∏ at Market Cap of **$295,537,484**.  

At launch, it will be the largest TVL (securing the integrity of the consensus) that will allow for uploading and execution of cw contracts. Among them, will be the **dao-contracts** of which Plurigrid has a fork that we intend to use the grant to grow into a CW incentives for energy sovereignty and reliability.

Our hybrid IBC pattern allows for any IBC-connected chain (i.e. there are relayers and incentives to run them) to join in being able to provide bootstrapping of Public Goods using permissionless and public ledgers **while** at the same time securing the smart grid private IBCs that we expect will emerge around sufficiently large communities, initially around nation-states, in the future - network states, corporations, and so on.  

# How the grants will be used by Plurigrid. 
- Grants will be received into DAO treasury and applied towards developer time, computational resources, gas costs to upload compiled contracts.
