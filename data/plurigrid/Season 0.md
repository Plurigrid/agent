Create all the possible prerequisites for the Energy Coordination Commons Season 1 (1 year long) to be successful at bringing us closer to the goal of a decentralized energy system and Type 1 Civilization.
## But what is a Commons?
1. Define clear group boundaries.
2. Match rules governing use of common goods to local needs and conditions.
3. Ensure that those affected by the rules can participate in modifying the rules.
4. Make sure the rule-making rights of community members are respected by outside authorities.
5. Develop a system, carried out by community members, for monitoring membersâ€™ behavior.
6. Use graduated sanctions for rule violators.
7. Provide accessible, low-cost means for dispute resolution.
8. Build responsibility for governing the common resource in nested tiers from the lowest level up to the entire interconnected system.
