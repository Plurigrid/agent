## _#3: Transitions_

Saying thank you as you step off the bus, walking from one place to another, the great gates that often mark the entrance to a chinatown, a revolving door, transitions are everywhere in the city. It is natural for us to have transitions between different kinds of spaces. This is also one aspect which digital space tends to lack: if you click a button to leave a Zoom call for example you get a jarringly instant cut from being ‚Äúin‚Äù the meeting to being ‚Äúout‚Äù of the meeting. This sort of immediate cut should ideally be avoided, and in particular it would be difficult/impossible for physical space to immediately switch from one state to another‚Äîwhich would be akin to teleportation.
