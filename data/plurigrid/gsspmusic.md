how do you avoid being compromised and price controlled?
Would love to discuss a concrete scenario you imagine

Credible, Optimal Auctions via Blockchains
eprint.iacr.org
But if you are asking about the auctions that have better studied threat model in this setting:

https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/114

but i’m less concerned about an auctioneer
so much as audience plants

VCG auction is the first one to specifically enable messages and actions that all auctions need to have, and Dart / Flutter (a mobile app framework for utilitarian quick mobile / desktop UIs) clients to work with via exposing the "Submit Bid" buttons and text boxes that take the bid in and interact with the contact :)

driving up or down the price

This will also allow for construction of gridSPICE microworld environments / labs to illustrate with tooling to express precisely the set of scenarios or even simply fuzz the mechanism and then be rewarded for finding a weakness that helps us make them more robust

is the bidder aware of the price?
I believe we will have to resort to a range of confidential auctions appropriate to the risks faced by those bidding

why not operate like futures contracts?

earn margin interest on positions

right now the risks for @Janita and I doing it on testnet to develop the interfaces and initial demo are minimal, so we do it in the clear -- but ultimately a gradual relaxation of privacy and various scenarios enabled by increasingly easy to use ZK approaches and others will enter

again why not incentivize this all like futures!

or is the goal less on price discovery and more on inflating the auction value?

because if you control the financial intermediary why not just earn that margin interest knowing you’re netted both ways and let the market take care of price discovery

gsspmusic
seems scammy
Not sure if the intent of this is to attack the character of the work or the mechanism, but I am sure you can relate to commitment here being to working out several pathways to bring auctions to environments where transactive energy does not exist now, and more broadly (despite the active need in the world toward which we are building this), this is the first mechanism in general and of course there is a range of other incentives we have in view and want to not overengineer for; in general constructive input on incentives to try is welcome as issues, and even more as PRs :)

gsspmusic
again why not incentivize this all like futures!
Futures indeed have precisely the placement within commitments

On capacity and demand

And being able to run confidential computations, like day ahead predictions, on more home data is useful for better models

gsspmusic
well they are intended as a hedge on risk

and that seems like that is the value here, connecting risk-seeking with risk-avoidant investors

like why the auction model and not long/short derivatives?
esp. with energy i’m just not sure i understand

Barton
we emphasize interoperability of many mechanisms including those develop elsewhere and see this as a way to maximize action spaces / trajectories explored by other (increasingly numerous) mechanism developing orgs and projects

Barton
our emphasis on privacy is also not only something we value as a human right, but a necessity for some of those confidential computation at the edge to happen in the first place as we will need to illustrate that this does not centralize data or suffer from flaws in weaker distributed training approaches

Barton
so by that token, the mechanism here is only the very first one, humbly expecting to pave ways to the orchestra of derivatives, predictable commitments to demand through placement of PoW nodes that happen to also secure more flexible execution layers from long range attacks, in fact many many more that we hope to develop into decentralized energy incentive taxonomy and legitimate / explain within the ontology from semantic web type approach where we can relate their value to the many

More than anything having this interoperable energy mechanism standard and protocol guaranteeing its sustainable is the game -- so seen in context, it is not the claim at all here that VCG is the end game and is the ultimate auction to solve all things

No, on the contrary, by using IBC and Actor model with message passing the claim that a universal enough foundation for experimentation, refinement, and ultimately iteration on IRL grid on which many mechanisms can be built and others integrated - that the resulting mix of choices that can be done by many instances of Plurigrids - will then successfully optimize for new grid expansion and its system properties

and that the ability to engage in coalition formation that will have alignment on the basis of social choice and confidential collective bargaining with transmission, ministries of energy, or really any communication distortion and monopoly on violence enabled self-serving existing entities that refuse to see cooperative games as better -- we will eventually have enough in the way of market share and relevance to indeed have a significantly better energy futures that are also more reliable than the existing highly volatile and signal-distorting intermediaries today

*energy future implementations backed by various commitments whose risk and historic behavior are reliably transmitted using systems of record with practical functional resilience to corruption particular to that region literally anywhere

The answer may be VRGDA for some Plurigrids, others may benefit from the replacement of funding models with structured things like ABCs or even networked absorption of risk under some mutual credit type funding and financial access broadening instrument, yet others will benefit from Data Unions, educational DAOs, or ZK unions and other labor instruments for electricians

To where the impact of strike can be derisked by formally verifying its responsible but effective use of striking by people yet continued acceptable utility of the electricity availability itself

So when we build and say we focus on interoperability, we mean it -- the current focus (about which, admittedly, there can be more clarity) is to build a foundation for sustainable expansion of primitives as digital public goods and their refinement

and usability by those actually looking to execute Interoperable smart asset / renewable incentives in a reliable manner, configurable by constituencies through structured delegation and rank ordering of outcomes from simulating their impact)

the real story about the https://github.com/Plurigrid/vcg-auction repo is not the mechanism (although I do legitimately welcome engagement around its robustness or really any engagement even if an occasional gm or an emoji reaction from those lurking)

-- the real story is CosmWasm contract instance that results from it, how blockspace sovereignty can lower the cost of securing integrity, and how IBC can allow for network effects to ultimately emerge around a more fair way of scaling our agency as users of electricity

And the concrete guarantor of agency is the admin on the contract instance - is it a DAO using a tokenized governance model or one using some variation of so-called "pluralistic" voting, a weighted multisig, or some NFT derived power? All are valid choices and up to sovereign decisions if we the people

One thing the admin is not is a shift operator one paycheck away from losing their home, or a CCA IT person who knows how and does anything CISO tells them, or an oligarch in parliament, or some CCP-established militarized junta

The admin and how our social choice propagate to ultimately something that engages in a variety of contexts on our behalf in structured predictable ways with well understood threat models is up to us :)

So TL;DR while VCG-auction exists as something concrete to enable the improvement of open source digital public good to which any viable set of mechanisms can be contributed in a way that can then run with fault isolation and scale in a way that can eventually allow for coordination needs anywhere to be met in a way that is interoperable and private

(which is EVM, but can participate in the IBC or IBC-like interchain message passing from a dedicated execution layer and proofs that yes, can also have ZK allowances that make up for the cost of light client verification from Ethereum side https://blog.succinct.xyz/post/2022/09/20/proof-of-consensus)

but we choose to focus on CosmWasm to start as avoiding this initial complexity

What eventual incentives that work will only be apparent in retrospect, our goal is to ensure that those along the way who will have worked on transactive energy market design and microgrid tech for many eons are not overwhelmed by this complexity and can mix and match grid designs and have ways of exposing game mechanisms at a lower price point to many devices via https://flutterflow.io)

And that whatever they design in deployment is sustainable to scale and operate that leaves configurable region and scenario appropriate mechanisms to make cheating very hard (ultimately by applying the standards of industrial assurance to our amplified preferences in energy mix and whether to emphasize rate or carbon footprint etc at all levels)

So if VCG does not fit the situation, and previous modeling on private inputs suggests VRGDA does better, you simply drag the other one from auctions sections; or if the strategy calls for installing more storage, you can instead include renewable potential or time of day incentive as simply as the other and be in the real world with Android, iPhone etc at lowest possible overhead and trust (established by successive iteration on interoperability and privacy primitives) in Plurigrid's ensuring the faithful execution of your intended incentive without being a modeling or blockchain expert

The plurality of Plurigrids in fact, where ownership in one by the body politik / peosumers / e-gens should allow the fair allocation of upside that results from trading with other coalitions and the network effects of interoperability and proof / privacy guarantees allowing for the revenue from p2p trading to arrive without nearly corruption by intermediaries (over time), and the upside from that -- sometimes even negative rates -- to flow directly to those now reliably enfranchised into their electricity grids value in the world, and their <battery / PV panel's / garage reactor's place in it>

And the implicit coordination that results from known edge or proofs / attestations of the configs of strategy profiles at each to allow for edge decisioning that derives a sound foundation for that energy commitment not from IEEE 1547 but now a way more formal guarantees whose strategy profiles implicitly do the effective thing after successive iteration on simulated and real perturbations and available to anyone who chooses to participate in the commons, not through the wishful thought or subsidies, but sustainable networks of ownership, value, and security that come from $GRID

TL;DR frfr It is not one mechanism or new set of rules of engagement that will do this, but we need to start with one end-to-end decentralized expansion planning example to then iterate -- so hope it addresses the "yes, and" to the VCG auction not being quite the cure to all grid's ills :) Gotta switch gears now, but thank you for your earnest examination of the efficacy and overall interest @gsspmusic -- will credit you in the blogpost this will eventually become when the demo is complete and roadmap of how to grow it to the vision supporting any approach anyone is willing to make interoperable with Plurigrids everywhere :)

Happy to also see how to incorporate what you see here into the architecture -- though will caution that as this thread is intentionally here for grid appreciators, the format of the Signal threads allows for only so much nuance or focused attention -- any serious dev effort is taking place in Zulip - to which I would love to invite anyone here who still thinks of Signal as the coordination mechanism sufficient for the task; so will welcome anyone interested in the process in-depth examination like the above lucky exception because I happened to check here (most days I am slow or don't at all) ^^ to get serious about being effective in helping the cause of UBS to join https://plurigrid.zulipchat.com/join/5vffrr3jwddnywzopwyagkud/
