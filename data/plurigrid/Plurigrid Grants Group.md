Wonderful! Thanks
@Amber Case
for starting this group. I'm aiming to find
time to get together an outline in the concept paper document tonight based on what I know about Plurigrid so far and the other opportunities that are available (the Fintech Innovation Lab for example which is Web3/ data/sustainability focused). Please populate it as needed with elements
you think should definitely be included and I'll work my outline around that.

I was on my way to get us an outline written following the instructions in the DOE GRIP FOA (under the Amendment 1 folder) but page 43 of that document has cost share requirements that I didn't know about. They're fairly steep at 50% of the total project costs. The other 50% for Topic Area 2 (Smart Grid grants) must come from non-federal sources. Thus if we
want $1M in grant funds for a $2M project, we will need $1M in matching
funds. Thoughts?

**Dahl Winters** 
If this is a barrier, I have other suggestions that do not require any cost
share. This one was really ideal though.

There are 3 options I think we could apply to. Let me know if any of these might be of interest. We set our own price and period of performance, so if it takes $3M over 3 years that's fine though shorter projects are always more preferable. For cloud deployments, they prefer Azure (in their FAQ

Maybe they might check their messages once or twice a day and have a meeting once a week. Thus we might have to do more of the planning and work on ERDC CERL and if they have some solution to the DOE GRIP cost
share they can let us know about it later.

If we need someone who has researched microgrids for 10 years to help with verification/validation of Plurigrid protocol operation to see if we're meeting DOE's resilience and sustainability goals, I can see that being of use to have Amin aboard. I'm thinking he would work with Rozhin together and Rozhin could work through us if we want to avoid having so many partners on the project. I know you have CU Boulder and probably a few
others to bring onboard as well.

Hey all, speaking of multiple outages affecting grid resilience, I had that problem this morning. Software update to my phone happened so I didn't hear my alarm and then Signal was nonfunctional on my main computer so I had to reboot. Perfect example of how one precipitating event can cascade into multiple events that interact to yield a negative outcome (me being 15 minutes late to an important meeting). All good here now, Case is laser-focused on getting podcast notes underway this very moment and I'm seeing that these notes are just what we need for both the DOE GRIP concept paper and any 3 minute videos we'd like to make in the future. I can help with both more efficiently now that I know more about the
concept and its implementation plans.

Found this on F6S just today which is where I submitted the Fintech Innovation Lab application yesterday for both fintech and insurtech applications. This is an insurtech challenge; I see Plurigrid providing electrical grid resilience and data on grid performance (or non-performance during hurricanes which can inform insurance claims). TN's expertise includes geospatial analytics for determining building and tree heights from satellite imagery over large
areas for insurtech purposes.
I do not think I have sufficient bandwidth to get all the F6S questions
answered so would like to see if someone els... **Read more**

Hi all, many apologies for not making it to the meeting today. The roof sported a leak and there was water damage on the outlets and my chargers. I've just found spare chargers while my old ones are drying and the electrician is coming later today. I'd love to still speak to Rozhin and
Amin soon. Will connect over slack

The meeting was very good.
I am compiling some resources for Dahl so we can be included in the

Thank you all for attending what turned out to be a highly productive meeting today. Our meeting notes are now available on our shared site under the Meeting Notes folder. If you do not have access, please let me know. All meeting attendees should currently have access. Any items we would like to discuss as a group resulting from these notes should be

posted below.
Amber Case is providing additional notes to me that I will include in the ERDC proposal. Progress on that proposal can be monitored also at this link, there is an ERDC folder that contains the submission. Any questions/ comments that are just for me can be made directly in that document; I
will see those and integrate as needed.
I will be writing tonight; my goal is to have the entire submission ready for
review/feedback by noon ... **Read more**

Just dropped this in from our Slack - getting on it soon as well! Some great notes already there on DOE GRIP @Xili, that concept paper will be great. Anything in ERDC should definitely help us all with DOE GRIP as
well.

Excellent, just reviewed it. I used much of the material here to describe Plurigrid’s work in the ERDC proposal since I saw it in an earlier document from Case’s podcast. Let me know if you would like me to add to it under
TN and wireless broadband or if you were planning to do that.
On the proposal, I had wanted to ask about where you saw NREL and GenX fitting in from a grid optimization perspective. TokenSPICE is described quite well in the above doc but NREL and GenX are blank and I
forgot to check on GenX for potential use in this proposal.

Didn’t want to bother Xili since I know she has some important home maintenance to take care of, but there is that other grant opportunity in Virginia on F6S I mentioned earlier that I have no bandwidth for. If it’s of interest to Plurigrid I’d be happy to catch her up on that so she can submit

Two overarching comments on the ERDC doc:

- Army benefits seem a bit tacked on to a more general proposal about

grid optimization
- Clarity as to which costs are technical and which are going to support
personnel is needed
In my limited NSF and other grant experience, opacity on this margin is a

red flag to proposal reviewers.
Additional minor comments embedded.

7:06 PM

EA
**Eric Alston** 
Also, is UDenver taking any overhead? If so, make sure that's not the 58% that CU Boulder took from my portion of an NSF grant. Does UDenver
have a grants office that needs to be formally looped in at some point?
7:07 PM
DW
**Dahl Winters** 
Excellent, thank you Eric, I’ll get those addressed. Good question about U of Denver. 58%, yikes. They do have a grants office, I’m going to get this discussed over on our Slack right now to make sure the slowness of the grants office doesn’t hold us back on ERDC. Not sure if CU Boulder has
any faster timing but if so, this might be worthy to consider on DOE GRIP.
7:11 PM
**Eric Alston** 
Ignore minor comments that strike you as resultant from my comparative
lack of expertise in this area.

I've had variable experience with CU grants office but am happy to help on
that margin if you all think going that route makes sense.

EA
One approach would be to apply and ask forgiveness from CU Denver later. For NSF at least, that is not an option, as the grants office has to
sign off on everything going to NSF.

I should also clarify that the ERDC proposal is not for a grant, but a contract to develop and deploy a product to meet this particular Army
need. Don’t know if that gets handled any differently at universities.

Am back to wrap up things for the night before we get our last reviews in tomorrow morning. The slide deck will be easier to do after the proposal

once we're all on track with what we'd like to do.
I caught up with Amin - there might be some uncertainties with using the DU campus we identified depending on what work we might like to do there. For DOE GRIP, he said it would make sense since we would be
performing deployment, not R&D. Not exactly clear on that.

As a reminder, there is a 10 day evaluation period for the ERDC CERL proposal which will result in a determination regarding funding since it is a CSO (Commercial Solutions Opening) for a federal contract, not a grant.

I had a great call with Jordan (https://peacelovefreedomventures.com/ about/) just now. We’re going to follow up on January 16 regarding TN’s plans to scale. He has quite a few industry verticals he works with where he believes our QMs would be of great value. I see he could be a great help to us with connecting and securing customer opportunities in those areas. He knows we’re tight on time, funds, and staffing right now so he’s checking in with Microsoft and Uber to see what might shake up funding/

partnership-wise this year or next.
I’m happy to make introductions before then with folks from our broader team here, if anyone is interested. He does have a JD which would come in handy on DOE GRIP if we do not already have a reviewer in mind for
that who has a legal perspective.

The format on the new BAA is different and it's more similar to DOE GRIP in that there are pre-proposal and full proposal stages. Our submission at present will need modification to fit those requirements, if indeed these are
both referring to the same ERDC CERL program.

How does plurigrid protocol use soverign ibc to scale transactive energy

Plurigrid Protocol uses Sovereign Interchain Communication (IBC) to scale transactive energy in microgrids. IBC is a protocol that enables
decentralized blockchain networks to securely and efficiently
communicate with each other.
In the case of Plurigrid Protocol, IBC allows for the secure and efficient exchange of information and value between different microgrids that are using the Plurigrid Protocol. This enables the Plurigrid Protocol to scale and support a large number of microgrids, without sacrificing security or
performance.
For example, when a DER in one microgrid sells excess energy to another microgrid, the transaction can be securely and efficiently processed using
IBC. This allows for seamless and effi... **Read more** 
plug plurigrid into chat gpt and cool things happen
Plurigrid Protocol uses a combination of zero-knowledge proofs (ZK), multiparty computation (MPC), and simulations to create game-theoretical
incentives for transactive energy markets in microgrids.
Zero-knowledge proofs are a type of cryptography that allow one party to prove to another party that they know a certain piece of information without revealing the actual information. This allows for the secure
exchange of information without sacrificing privacy.
Multiparty computation is a technique that allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function without revealing their inputs to each other. This can be used to create secure and verifiable transactions in a decentralized
network.
Simulations are used to model and analyze the behavior of participants in

very entertaining

"how are incentive models created for transactive energy markets"
Incentive models for transactive energy markets are typically created using game theory, which is a branch of economics that studies strategic decision-making. Game theory is used to model the interactions between different participants in a market, and to identify incentives that can
encourage participation and cooperation.
To create an incentive model for a transactive energy market, game theorists typically start by defining the different players in the market, and the rules of the game, such as the market rules and the actions that participants can take. They then use mathematical tools and simulations to analyze the behavior of the players in different scenarios, and to identify
incentives that can encourage participa... **Read more**

Plurigrid Protocol is a decentralized protocol for managing and coordinating distributed energy resources (DERs) in microgrids. It uses a combination of blockchain technology, interchain communication (IBC), zero-knowledge proofs (ZK), and multiparty computation (MPC) to create a
secure, efficient, and scalable platform for transactive energy in
microgrids.
One of Plurigrid's key strengths is its ability to model and simulate grid solutions and resources before deployment. Using simulation tools, Plurigrid can create provable models of grid systems that can be safely tested before deployment. This allows grid operators to better understand the potential impacts and benefits of different grid configurations, and to make informed decisions about how to deploy and manage DERs in their

It sounds like the Peer-to-Peer Distributed Controller project aims to develop a decentralized control system for managing the energy usage of a campus or other large facility. The system would involve smart panels, DERs (distributed energy resources), and network switches that can communicate and make decisions in real-time to optimize the system's operation. This approach is different from traditional centralized control systems, which rely on a single controller for decision-making and
optimization.
The Energy Management System developed by Resilient Englement (RE) is a tool for tracking and managing energy usage in both normal and emergency situations. It is based on the ISO 50001 standard, which provides guidelines for developing an energy management system (EMS)

**The James C. Kennedy Mountain Campus | University of Denver**At the James C. Kennedy Mountain campus at the University of Denver, all students immerse themselves in the holistic approach to education that sets DU apart: the 4D Experience. The four integrated dimensions—advancing intellectual growth, exploring character, promoting well-being and pursuing lives and careers of purpose—will guide every program and activity on the mountain, just as they do on our urban campus. The Kennedy Mountain Campus is for the entire DU community, and all students—from those studying music to those exploring the sciences—have an opportunity to engage with this space throughout their time at DU. Here, there is something for every learner to expand upon and apply to their studies on DU’s urban campus. Thanks to the generosity of our donors and supporters, these experiences are available with no additional financial burden to our students or their families. With the creation of the Kennedy Mountain Campus, we are the only university to integrate both an urban and a mountain campus, offering the opportunity for every student to grow in multiple dimensions in order to lead lives of purpose, for themselves and
for the greater good.

from dahl earlier: grid operations can be simulated at a very large scale and we will have easier control over what runs on each compute instance. I’m thinking each instance could represent a microgrid of up to 100 users, all with different DERs and storage systems. We could then add instances as other microgrids come online, and each instance’s microgrid would have a geographic area for the purposes of simulating grid disruptions. If Amin’s test software will run on a single machine to simulate a whole microgrid, this could be ideal so we could reuse standard test sets and conditions, and we could have several options for making the connections
needed to Plurigrid’s tech

Had a couple of questions

I'll leave them as doc comments as well, but wanted to zoom in on the
meaning of "indefinitely" for island mode for campus microgrid operation?
i.e. indefinitely given a rate of renewable energy generation + adjustments
to power consumption around campus
orrr
", with lights, heat, internet, phones, medical services, and shelter for area residents of an area that encompasses approximately 37 square miles of rugged mountain territory. As previous Incident Commands know the strategic value of this property from past experience, they will undoubtedly choose to use the campus as a base, which will allow serving as an information hub providing public information dissemination during fires, disasters, or catastrophes, thereby preventing public confusion and panic through situational knowledge, awareness, and information." -- riveting
story!
5:26 PM


I am highlighting the sections that I will re-work to highlight the protocol aspects that are pertinent, e.g. MPC for predictive maintenance modeling

and system of record
5:27 PM

Several references to "Plurigrid control" exist, however, a more appropriate view of the protocol's contribution would be as a system of record and assurance for control being executed -- given device integrations, it makes sense to partner up with Enode, David Energy or
similar;
Concretely, Plurigrid's ledger will record:
- what has transpired in the DU microgrid
- that given what has transpired, correct control steps were executed
using the device control tooling

TL;DR for those following at home -- ultimately the natural disasters and other types of disturbances will be translatable into one of the
Perturbations in NREL SIIP
We can make it translatable. And our test strategy can allow for 2 types of simulations, one incorporating the above and one that is using whatever U of Denver is using (I'm not sure but it's apparently pretty standard). Same disruption scenarios for both, and both able to deliver the same metrics to describe grid resilence (I had described 5 of these in the concept paper I
think).

of course, static is not always the case, so the dynamics can be modeled

These will certainly apply over transmission lines - anything local using DC (past the inverter) will not have reactive capacitance and inductance.
