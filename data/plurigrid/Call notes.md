Call notes

Token involved in the obligation clearing
And then once again create a better energy future

—

What I’m really interested in seeing — this is Dec Jan
Can you be doing token simulations

Open source — our first hire https://github.com/Plurigrid/vcg-auction
Whenever you have transitive energy splitting up the generation to these people
Right now going through to this municipal contract

10 participants in this process
Coordination commons

And then all of this would be done manually

Competing bidders
Make a very simple rule
For 2 iterations
The bidding succeeds with a coalition of 3
Then they switch sides

Showing that over time all 10 of the bidders
Will join the co-alition switch competing goals to cooperative goals

Many types of auctions possible
I won’t make the bid revealed until there is an action

Mechanism
The user experience of making this possible
Flutter flow
And initially the devices auto bid and you don’t need to as a human

When we try to collatorize back assets
Energy futures or credit certificate
But they all have a structure that knows about risk and provide for an easy decision to deploy capital vs. the energy derivates deployed today

Permissionless blockchains
The premise where we started
With energy grid

IBC handle the volume of transactions

IMPLICIT coordination
Round trip — microworld strategy what they’ll do based on what they observe

Social algorithmic choice in choosing to update the strategy in how to update this trading
The people have to make tradeoffs between different utility payoffs

By letting go of every iteration needs to be networked
By those new modalities it’s okay to find the right tradeoff
Proof of work nodes — bitcoins

Proof of word nodes allow for wa more structured demand to more carefully model the future with day ahead predictions
The goal of the mechanism is not so much speed but veracity

If the system breaks apart — if Iran puts in a firewall — the plurigrids will still function

There are use cases for sure — proof of energy
Super grateful for the ability to elaborate these pieces

Monetary systems keeps butting up against environmental and electrical
