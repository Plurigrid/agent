«You now seem to be saying that 'superintelligence,' like 'miracle' or 'perpetuum mobile,' is coherent (in the "we could recognize it if we saw it" sense) but not physically realizable.»

# Gitcoin Public Goods GR15 grant proposal for Plurigrid
What is Plurigrid
https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/siip.html

### Public Good 
Plurigrid - as predominantly the Public Good, is the Energy Coordination Commons Protocol. It will coordinate distributive energy grids by filling the critical absence of an Optimal Concensus Mechanism. The protocol will approach verifiable neutrality, as true neutrality is but an empty ideal that cannot be concretely implemented. Concrete implementation of our protocol will, in time, bring the public good of stable energy supply to all humans, super-human structures, and beyond.

We aim to create 3 causally linked simulation domains and practical Public Goods mechanisms to bootstrap and scale their implementation in enabling informed sovereign community decisions and reliable electricity supply.

## Energy Coordination Commons
Energy Coordination as a Public Good.
### Funding Mechanisms
Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC)
Generalized Dutch Auctions (GDA)
...and others that aim to establish a funding model where investors are not unfairly advantaged in the public good being bootstrapped, while the incentive structures are sufficiently robust to attract the necessary capital to bootstrap the public good.

### Governance



Concretely, it is a Julia package that implements Scalable Infrastructure Planning Initiative, concrete incencentives, and incentive design toolkit for use in energy products and services. 
## Problem
The grid instability is growing and one of the responses is to practice intermittent scheduled outages to prevent a larger unscheduled and uncontrolled blackout, like as of this writing in California. Who gets rugged? Actually, everyone. A blunt and blind shut down is oblivious to individual household/ business needs. So, we will help eliminate illusory shortages -- for we have the capacity. 


## Short project description
Global energy coordination effort. Grid-stabilising protocol that meets extraneous energy demands.
