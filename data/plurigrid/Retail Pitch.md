The world's electricity grid is under increasing strain.

Changing climate and social instability posses greater than ever risk of grid instablity. Result? Power outages, energy waste, rising energy prices, uncertainity.

Current technolody of smart grids allow for better stability of the grid. Yet, we have not found the solution that would be optimal application for smart grids that could protect user data and provide energy sovereignity to states and individuals. 

Plurigrid is Energy Coordination Commons Protocol. It will utilise technology that allow individuals to run grid similation to analyse and see what works and what doesn't.

Plurigrid will contribute to commons contracts, making it easier for the public to design their own energy systems on the blockchain.

As result, the data received through the grid sumulation on chain will help individuals and entreprises create better energy systems for their own benefits, benefits of their communities and busineses. At the same time preserving their data privacy. 

Plurigrid as the commons protocol, will alow states, busineses, indviduals for better energy managment creating more efficient energy markets. Greener, cheaper and sovereign.
