The use of blockchain technology for conducting auctions and the creation of a "VCG auction" mechanism to allow for a secure and interoperable auction environment.

The goal is to develop a flexible and interoperable energy mechanism that can be used as a foundation for various other mechanisms in the future.

The emphasis is on privacy, security, and decentralized control over data and decision-making processes. The aim is to achieve a more reliable energy future that is not controlled by intermediaries and emphasizes human agency.

Plurigrid protocol uses VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) auctions as part of a broader effort to bring auctions to environments where transactive energy doesn't currently exist.

The goal is to provide interoperability between different auction mechanisms and to emphasize privacy as a human right and a necessity for some of the confidential computations that need to occur.

VCG is not the final goal but the first step in a long-term project to build a universal and sustainable energy mechanism standard and protocol.

The hope is that this foundation will allow for experimentation, refinement, and iteration of various solutions for grid expansion and its system properties, such as VRGDA, ABCs, data unions, educational DAOs, and ZK unions, among others. The ultimate goal is to achieve a better and more reliable energy future that is backed by various commitments and has functional resilience to corruption.

The goal of the VCG auction mechanism is to create a foundation for experimentation, refinement, and ultimately iteration on real-world grid systems.

The mechanism is intended to maximize the action spaces and trajectories explored by other mechanism-developing organizations and projects by emphasizing interoperability with other mechanisms.

VCG auctions also prioritize privacy and aim to ensure that confidential computations at the edge are not centralized and do not suffer from weaknesses in weaker distributed training approaches. T

he VCG mechanism is the first in a series of mechanisms and not the end-game solution for all things.

The focus is on creating a sustainable and interoperable energy mechanism standard and protocol, which will eventually lead to a better energy future through market share and relevance.

The optimal solution may be different for different Plurigrids, and may include a mix of mechanisms such as VRGDA, structured funding models, networked risk absorption, or ZK unions.

For a specific thing that Plurigrid enables others to have via gridIBC

The only important device right now Is a relayer node Making sure that it does not corrupt the signal of the messages it carries into new and exciting places.
