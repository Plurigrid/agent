Breaking it down even more after the session with [[../People/Ollie Williams]] [[../People/Erin Vanderberg]]

So YouTube recommended this video and I realized that this is the level at which people expect me to explain things https://youtu.be/E-yPK_7DZSw -- speed / content depth / problem statement etc :) but yeah - this is a decent enough problem statement, everything you have been hearing is a solution :)

I wanted to emphasize once again: **improve coordination in energy markets**;

Concretely, we replace the [[Industrial Control Systems]] in the existing grid with [[../../../World/Organizations/Plurigrid]], which is a set of technologies fulfilling concrete roles within the energy market coordination - around governance, delegation, formal specification of intent and values, as well as, data veracity.

Since this is a hard science / engineering effort, the set of technologies and what they do (correctly so, no hand waving!) should roll of our tongues, even if we do not always fully grok the lowest detail and instead have to rely on our comrades for that or enlist new comrades who are reliable for that understanding.

Because of that, the game consists of some logos, that I hope we can work on understanding by asking questions _and_ capturing the resulting entity and some set of personal notes about it either as an Inbox item, if you don't know where to put it -- or as an item in the taxonomy of directories, like `Market` or `Technology` or `Philosophy` that are there to get you started. After you do one, add a backlink to it under your name below, e.g. if I do [[../Technology/Anoma]] (not pictured, but prevalent), I would then, after writing about in the way that I believe is both fully correct (if not complete) and understandable by someone other than myself, add an item like this:

- [[../Technology/Anoma]]

The goal of the game is to complete all top level concepts and relations, and then interconnect them in our knowledge graph in a way that can convey their place and applicability in the broader Plurigrid ecosystem (all the participants as well)

Prof will connect me with [[simulation]]-oriented political scientist. More on that forthcoming. 

Absolutely, we need to improve coordination amongst ourselves. Let's.
