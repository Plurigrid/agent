## Addressing context of current priorities for dev

(questions originally in Zulip `general#plurigrid`)
**Why is coordination better than competition?**
<https://cybercat.institute/projects/>
_Mathematical framework_:

- compositional game theory
- morphisms of open games
- open games with agency

_Practical reality_:

- Fully Decentralized Policies for Multi-Agent Systems: An Information Theoretic Approach
- Distributed Energy Trading and Scheduling among Microgrids via Multiagent Reinforcement Learning

**What makes Plurigrid different and likely more effective?**
**Plurigrid Protocol**
A maximally flexible and configurable protocol for any agentic amplification primitives needed by a person or group of persons when participating in transactive energy markets, or, indeed, in the course of expanding, maintaining, robustifying, evolving, and any interaction whatsoever with electricity-using systems in general. This is includes purely financial uses of Plurigrid Protocol that may not even have (for that Plurigrid instance) anything in the way of physical hardware, microgrids, or really any IRL footprint whatsoever, and can an only exist to enable coordination around something like mutual credit funding of new development in a different Plurigrid or Plurigrids; or, to use another example, may consist of zero-knowledge organized labor Plurigrid of electricians verifiably striking at a certain date. On the other end of physical presence, some Plurigrid instances, e.g. in Tanzania, will center specifically around using the inertia in the price mechanism to guide topologically correct placement of resources, sustainable growth, and expose microgrids to the catalog of hardware appropriate to their renewable energy region.
    Yet other Plurigrid instances can help recover from disaster in a coordinated manner (e.g. restarting a nuclear power plant, re-establishing governance and civil society via being the only resilient voting mechanism, allocating fuel between Air Force bases) -- in this case financial aspects are not necessary or furthermore, can be harmful - but the faithful implementation of implicit coordination strategies by microinverters within the organization that controls the entire grid (i.e. no market) still offer value.

    Protocol consists of:
    - consensus mechanism (from: PoW or VDF-on-energy nodes that immediately provide for resilient mechanism _and_ a commitment on demand + Babylon Chain type intermittent timestamping into this PoW mechanism from a more flexible execution environment like CosmWasm as a defence against long range attacks, to: government-audited nuclear power plant system of record for enriched fuel, to fully centralized CCA software choosing to still engage in the portions of the Commons - e.g. the models -- that individual Plurigrids want to commercialize)
    - pluralistic agency-scaling technologies (conversational agents, open games): participants must be able to make informed decisions about the utility (i.e. comfort, fulfillment) of proposed possible futures and consider the tradeoffs necessary for growing their sovereignty, in an intiutitive, contextualized way https://generative.ink/posts/language-models-are-multiverse-generators/
    - sustainable economies of value for the "arena" of the open games to be a computationally and socioeconomically feasible target for practical discovery of strategy profiles in the embodied, applied experience of bootstrapping the microworld economy necessary for "structured revolution" (enabling the energy transition)
        = $GRID is supposed to capture the utility of having incentivized computation for microworld execution and interaction, in-Plurigrid computation of MPC look-ahead models, computation of the conversational knowledge agent and intermediary, ...
        - once you "own" a microworld, executing it indefinitely should be feasible
    - once we discover agentic strategy profiles through coordination (mix of competition and cooperation etc.), the protocol does not dictate anything other than:
            - *interoperability* throughout the growth stages of any Plurigrid anywhere - ensure that coordinating even in the nominal capacity of leaving a relayer channel open and having enough value for relayer operators to keep the gridIBC relayer alive -- an equivalent of having a back channel to North Korea that is mostly dormant, but is there in case we are about to destroy the world to make one last phone call (it is also there for forming larger and larger coalitions that eventually may include all of us)
            - *privacy* safety in expressing choice, new trajectories for optimal control, but also, identity is one of the least solved issues in centralized and decentralized software systems -- by having unique granularity of data for the protocol, we are able to have the primitives for DID:e:* way of fingerprinting devices, ML models, or humans through the latent cloud of signal in how they go about their energy uses every day -- to not advantage intermediaries that are still there and have monopoly on violence, it is critical that we also see Plurigrid Protocol's interoperability as serving intelligence functions;

Structured revolution (n -> n + 1):

DAO n-1 LLC, CCA, PG&E
DAO n EIP-20, EIP-721, Quadratic Voting etc.
DAO n+1 ...

Prerequsities:

- sufficient energy to reconfigure the game
- reachability of the desired states from current state

Not really a company, not really software, not really even about the grids or energy scarcity.
We believe in the coming world of energy abundance.
Plurigrid is a world, an idea, a political economy meets emerging tech, considered holistically as a closed cybernetic loop that we are seeking to instrument.

Want to accelerate application of scientific understanding to addressing existing misalignments as manifested in negative externalities.

0. discover negative externality or inefficient / unfairly intermediated portion of the overall energy market
"govern communication in the digital public sphere, and introduces and defends a democratic egalitarian theory of communicative justice." <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97U8BZAbJYo>

1. help communities to most effectively apply counter-measures through mechanism design, but even more importantly, sheer size of the coalitions formed (at one point, the interoperating Plurigrids will form a more powerful block than OPEC, US Commodities Market & Exchange etc.)

2. legitimate the value of coordinating as a coalition of coalitions using a credibly and practically neutral layer.

What is plurigrid's true value proposition, as compared to the other companies that are attempting similar things? is it:

- a. better data due to emitting more from edge-devices, by way of privacy-ensuring computational methods, and thereby better predictive models?
- b. better coordination strategies and models due to compositional game theory, open games, simulating a multitude of different algorithms
- c. The ability for consumers to express more agency by indicating granular preferences w.r.t energy sources, peers, and consumption -- nuanced
- d. the ability to 'interoperate' across grids and thereby share more information & have a wider action space through which to aggregate larger coalitions of coalitions that can be powerful negotiating adversaries when faced with entrenched monopolies, governments
- e. all of the above and / or something else I'm missing?

thirdly:

what exactly does our simulation framework aim to do? or more specifically, what is the MOST IMPORTANT thing our simulation framework should aim to demonstrate?

- there are maany strategies and algorithms presented in research papers about transactive energy. Are there particular strategies which we are biasing towards simulating, and why?

OPF with accurate agentic utility choices.

finally, I still don't understand "where the electrons go" haha. If person A trades energy with person B from a distance, I assume the energy goes from person A to their local grid, and to person B from their local grid - in the context of a lot of these energy trades happening, how can we reason that energy is being saved, or what is this mechanism providing over the existing one?
