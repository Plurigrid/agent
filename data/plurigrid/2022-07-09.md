# `$MATRIX` - simulation token from [[../../../World/Organizations/Plurigrid]]
![[../Attachments/Plurigrid - NREL.png]]

to be available on https://plurigrid.xyz/matrix as the way for a self-bootstrapping energy grid simulation value network, combined with the ability and a dApp / product to run your own simulations that will allow you to:

- run an Akash container or series of containers including w/ GPUs (when functionality comes out) to execute a full-scale, self-contained Plurigrid simulation (includes all the chains involved in the recording of generation / transmission / consumption of power)
- the simulation itself will be indexed and exposed as a GraphQL queryeable indexed dataset asset, that social, systems, energy scientists can use to understand what happened (example of what kind of [[simulation]] types can be run is here: https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy20osti/73071.pdf READ THIS or be lost)

- self-bootstrapping public good that is going to use Nouns DAO type weekly mint of a simulation -- starting with [[../../../Technology/cadCAD]] in a single Docker container with a single chain, and growing to become full-fledged grid simulations at 100 chains, synthetic data based on historic modeling, IBC analogue etc etc.
- those who get these weekly Non-Fungible Simulations will be eligible for ongoing airdrops of `$MATRIX` token as simulation environment evolves
- going to a large-scale IRL deployment in 6 months preceded by several IRL deployments based on simulations thus far (example clarification: an IRL deployment can be a solar field or other [[Distributed Energy Resource]]) operator who agrees to switch out their existing Industrial Control System to the one Plurigrid offers w/ its models for coordination in the event of a grid disruption subject to the standard 
- the simulations exist to try out various scenarios that can occur
## Tokenomics
- simulation token for self-bootstrapping network of value around running simulations of the grid
- airdrop to these organizations [[../People/Xili Mo]]: << please add here -- orgs that we support that do simulation already (onboarding UX priority - easy flow with authorization)
- $MATRIX tokens allows participants to bid on the grid simulation mints
- Holding a simulation mint makes you elligible for future $MATRIX token airdrops

https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy20osti/73071.pdf -- run simulations of energy grid as determined by this paper, starting with very simple [[../../../Technology/cadCAD]] sims and growing as `$MATRIX` allows for more simulations.

Divvying [[../ðŸ’¡ â˜¼ Inbox/$MATRIX]] 1st year, each 5%, to [[../../publicpluri/orgs/NREL]], [[../Organizations/Topos Institute]], political simulation people at Berkeley referred to by [[../People/Daniel Lee]]. Other options include CyberCat, University of Waseda in Japan, and GREQAM https://edirc.repec.org/data/greqafr.html research in France. 25% of initial tokens for "good people". Potentially some social engineering org, perhaps [[../ðŸ’¡ â˜¼ Inbox/Stephen Pimentel]] could offer more insight into that.

$MATRIX 999,999,999 over 9 years + _the_ 1 final $MATRIX token to be minted when minting functionality is going to be disabled automatically.
