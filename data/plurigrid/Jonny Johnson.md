## Interests in Plurigrid:
I joined because I hoped to see some compositional game theory on display. I hope I can contribute to Plurigrid in some way on designing games. First, I need a few weeks to get ingrained into it and see the nature of the game. I am not an energy or policy expert.

## Dev Skills:
Seems there might be talented people involved in this project. I might stand out among everyone as being the Flutter dev.
