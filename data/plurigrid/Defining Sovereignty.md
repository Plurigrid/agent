Met with a broadly historical political theorist to discuss governance simulations, will be consulting with [[../People/Daniel Lee]] regularly from now on over ideology with a historical perspective. The prof provided feedback that [[Sovereignty]] might not be correctly used on what we're doing. Rather, one must consider the Hobbesian hob of power that exercises a prohibitive power over "the people". Prof Lee suggested for us to consider the foil to our [[Ethos]], in that a prohibitive sovereign (interchain structure) is necessary to set the ground rules but not sufficient for accurate web3 governance models. Will be thinking more about that.
