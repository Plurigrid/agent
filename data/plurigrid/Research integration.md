## Category Theorists, Poli Sim, Cybernetics
 Scientists are not merely theory validators, they consult on the effective way in solving climate crises. The experts will offer research advise on cybernetics, governance, grid design to solve ripple power outages from an unstable grid. They offer legitimacy to modifying energy production incentives and align those with individual nodes— humans— on the grid. The energy distribution grid will be the model on which water distribution, gas, connectivity grids can be built. Graphical representations of real life game theoretical scenarios will be critical in political sims, social sims, societal sims. Welcome to the power game.
