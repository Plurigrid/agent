## Prepare Simulation Examples & Tutorials
**Multimodal:** [https://github.com/Plurigrid/PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl](https://github.com/Plurigrid/PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl) (modality of power distribution) +  [https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/ibctest](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/ibctest) (modality of private IBC - or infra for generalized message passing together with Celestia - data availability)
**Multiobjective:**
[https://github.com/cadCAD-org/cadCAD](https://github.com/cadCAD-org/cadCAD) - these are agent-based -- but extending towards cadCAD.jl (which is work in progress, and we get to substantively contribute -- needs to be fast and not be a bottleneck for others)
**Multidomain:**
in this starting to look at the security components of generating grid anomalies -- seeing how we can set up a benchmark that Department of Energy would align on, [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6665110](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6665110)  [https://www.academia.edu/25633842/Stochastic_Games_for_Power_Grid_Protection_Against_Coordinated_Cyber_Physical_Attacks](https://www.academia.edu/25633842/Stochastic_Games_for_Power_Grid_Protection_Against_Coordinated_Cyber_Physical_Attacks) -- so modeling the security domain / adversary
