[Bonding Curve]
	The price of new tokens is based on the imposed scarcity of total supply
		new buyers will have to pay slightly more for coins
	Augmented bonding curve
		-   **Front-running**: We’ve been actively exploring solutions to front-running and other “buying” manipulation. Billy Rennekamp has done some great [analysis into potential solutions](https://medium.com/@billyrennekamp/batched-bonding-curves-ce69a57d8ae4) including [batched bonding curves](https://github.com/okwme/batchedBondingCurves).
-   **“Circuit-breakers”:** We believe that in the early days of any new, experimental system, there has to be safety mechanisms in place that can automatically turn off system functions if certain conditions such as a destructive ‘pump and dumps’, manipulation of governance processes, or overall system failure. Potential solutions range from global settlements to manual resets (i.e. non-majority requiring multisigs).
-   **Non-arbitrary parameterization:** For our simulations, we set most numbers as arbitrary estimations to test. For implementation and future testing, we recognize the need for economic analysis of how the parameters (θ, ϕ, d₀, p₀) affect the system at scale.
