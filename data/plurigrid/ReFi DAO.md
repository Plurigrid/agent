**Proposed:** Plurigrid's Energy Coordination Circle ⚡️

https://github.com/Plurigrid/moose/blob/main/tutorials/scientific-computing-multiple-players.ipynb

Through combination of **multi-party computation** for more robust and effective spot market / integrity models, a coordination layer that uses Anoma Network Intents and Validity Predicates operating in public, as well as a shielded way to transact between the microgrids and outside world w/ Namada / Penumbra together with a robust data availability layer (**modular design**), we can see our way to faster deployment of capital to emerging energy markets, solving of thorny issues around trade secrets that prevented wider adoption of better practices and standards (IEEE 1547 and IEEE 2030). We will test the hypothesis that not requiring the training data to leave the Distributed Energy Resource silos will eventually incentivize all new developments to join Plurigrid by making it the best way to compete. That training and maintaining sector-leading models of the totality of data among Plurigrid participants and making them available from the very first day will make Plurigrid the best commercial as well as public option. We will remain nimble with new information constantly sampled from the agent-based simulations, experts, and eventually real world data with concurrent experimentation. In addition to the adaptability of these simulations, various "incentive mixes" are easily translated into energy consumption and products, making Plurigrid infinitely adaptable.

Our focus on value pluralism allows the use of Plurigrid by participants who may not agree with each other's value sets, but can formally verify that (a) the closest match to theirs can be found using our (b) the programmable markets can allow for the plurality of smart grids to achieve system level objectives through optimal control mechanisms whose workings are not opaque.

We hold baseline level of access to electricity to be a human right and are building a planetary scale energy market coordination layer to make it a practical reality. ⚡️

Since the stakes are high, our goal is to pioneer the first of its kind ReFi energy incentive simulation framework and energy product development platform. Concretely, we aim to use cadCAD, TokenSpice, and other Token Engineering / Commons Stack resources in combination with domain-specific energy simulation tooling like https://github.com/NREL/dgen with several well-documented simulations together with encrypted models + a wide variety of token designs (e.g. [Fractal Ownership](https://medium.com/freeelio-studios/a-theory-of-fractal-ownership-part-1-introducing-value-based-ownership-54e7edc58953) to achieve the following:

- show significance! through agent-based simulations, the addition of Plurigrid to existing smart / autonomous energy grids needs to concretely address the existing coordination failures by discovering new strategies for energy markets as well as verifying the viability of those that have not been tested
- bootstrap simulation compute economy by launching a simulation token and xApp that can execute the simulations on sufficient amount of Akash (soon to have GPUs), including the public goods tier that is going to use excess compute off-peak to run grid epochs in the Simulation Commons
- by observing extreme outcomes in simulations, establish structured risk management for this critical infrastructure effort
- start relating the dynamics observed in simulation to historic data
- iteratively build partnerships with experts / energy scientists and engineers at places like NREL, IEA, and other aligned organizations

While Plurigrid as a public good for our species and does not have an expiration date / will  continue while there is thermodynamic free energy to be had, individual efforts participating in Plurigrid will have paths to commercialization and our intention is to have the first batch of Plurigrid partners launch integrations within IRL developments that use Plurigrid mainnet in 6-12 months and their growth to play out in ways that reward backers over 10-20 years. Alongside it we will continue supporting research into responsibly automating Industrial Control Systems, and assurance around all levels of the grid systems through formal methods.

**Gift:** simulation token airdrop to try running your own microgrids using open-source dApps that we develop

**Goal:** prepare to launch an energy spot market IRL ⚡️ with 5 or more initial Plurigrid members onboarded and using it for settlement / impacts de-risked through simulation by an intersectional DeSci Plurigrid community that will at that point include the majority of researchers / engineers innovating in this space.
