Validity predicates are a unique feature of Anoma and are used to determine the validity of a state transition. This assessment is done by evaluating the state transition received as an argument by the validity predicate function. On Anoma, each account and token standard has exactly one associated validity predicate. During the execution phase of a transaction, both the validity predicates associated with the sender/receiver and the token involved will be called. Each triggered validity predicate will independently evaluate this state change, which will either be accepted or rejected based on the evaluation. As validity predicates are very flexible, they can be tailored to handle a variety of use cases. This model for transaction execution is architecturally more elegant and ergonomic than a step-by-step flow model in which contracts call each other.
