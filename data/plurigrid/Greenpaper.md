üëΩüí° **Plurigrid is an idea.**
Like a splinter in your mind, it beckons you to imagine a world, a Commons where we can look past our differences when it comes to [things](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/capitalist-realism-by-mark-fisher/id1502659321?i=1000471749869) that matter to _all_ of us. 

[Plurigrid is a world]() where we can **address planetary scale challenges** and negative externalities resulted by centralised control of fundamental public goods, so that the sentient life can _make it_. Earthly life is sacred to Plurigrid. It is a word encapsulating freedom to associate with those we like and agree with, where disagreement results in independence rather than compromise, and one where abundance grants us kindness towards those whom we merely accept. 

Our ethos is to never be identified with the forever wrong, occasionally useful models of reality, or any finite representations. Model weights or "on-chain" footprints are pale imitations of the pluralistic reality we inhabit-- thinking we have truth condemns us to dogmatism. As such, Plurigrid will capture the multiplicity in values and in lived experiences in a truly neutral platform. Plurigrid is designed to promote natural social organization according to one's own will so that one's will is never subject to another's. Plurigrid is the structure that prohibits individuals from accruing unearned power and influence over their commons, i.e. no dictatorship over the commons!

Openess, transparency, efficiency, power to all.

In addition to defining Plurigrid's core values, we must draw the line of what we are not. No central governance that subscribes to jurisdictional entities that will be exploitable to unbalanced power games (not the least through administrative paperwork); it is not a network state where private property is the ultimate right when Plurigrid, fundamentally, provides a public good. Vehemently, it is not to be identified with any technologies that enable it today. Promoting pluralistic values requires pluralistic means of access. Cross-platform adaptability minimises friction and maximises ease in onboarding onto our commons project. In the beginning, technology choices will allow for everyone to have access to the grid, then, the birbs will take over. Birbs have referential transparency that allows for seamless development.
Any and all applications that Plurigrid incorporates need to always be evaluated against these **Guiding Star principles** ‚ú®
- we need a verifiably neutral [Energy Coordination Commons]()
- baseline level of access to electricity (e.g. for refrigeration) is a natural human right
- whole [Earth system]()
- the widespread means to flourishing
- no power-leeches

# Pluralism
Governance with fitted value sets that can allow people with similar energy use preferences/values to aggregate and make the optimal governance decisions. This makes sure the universal adoption of pluralism and the end of hegemonic DER control. One must consider the Hobbesian center of power that exercises a prohibitive power over "the people". Hegemony prohibits the freedom of association that best meets the need for public goods. Plurigrid will provide the integrative infrastructure for multi-platform operations and encourage communities of shared values to emerge naturally from that structure. There will be no so-called necessary prohibitions, but privacy and freedom will be guaranteed. We at Plurigrid do not have the best organizational structure to fascillitate implementing [open games](https://julesh.com/2017/09/29/a-first-look-at-open-games/). But our approach to the truth comes from simulation scientists that make governance models, agent-based simulations, grid configurations that will validate choices made by Commons with reference to [value generation]. 

# Fairness Mechanisms
First, we address criteria for effective ground-up governance. 
- _Unrestricted domain_: All members of a commons will have a vote and have their preferences reflected in governance with validity predicates.
- _Non-dictatorship_: dictatorship in practice is unideal. That the voting results will mirror a single person's preferences is important to understand for a more effective preventative measure against apparent value homogeneity. Plurigrid is the infrastructure that will allow for a plurality of preferences to be optimally met, and not have any person be subject to the absolute will of another. 
- _Pareto efficiency_: No participant can be made better off without making another participant worse off. Instead of relying on the "veil of ignorance" (Rawls) where no one is better off according to centralised decision-making, all participants will have their preferences protected by maximising their political effectiveness without having an unfair weight over another. 
- _Independence of alternatives_: Irrelevant issues will not affect voters' preferences. 

[Arrow's impossibility theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem), where ranked preferences cannot be converted to actions without violating at least one of the above criteria. The problem arises out of an obfuscation of voter intent from imperfect information gathering, inflated voter numbers, intent-matching. These issues are currently addressed by the [Anoma protocol](https://anoma.net/vision-paper.pdf) where the consensus layer engages all members with intent-matching validity predicates. Plurigrid commons will implement this protocol with manageable quora so that signals of intent are clear and heard. The commons will have distributed voting mechanisms that verifiably assigns political power to all and will provide incentives for coordination for the good of the whole. 

The [8 rules for self-governing](https://serve-learn-sustain.gatech.edu/managing-commons-eight-principles-self-govern) will be met in every commons. The requirements were naturally met by our commons philosophy.

## Simulation categories
Simulations are crucial to commons engineering. They will engage scientists to adopt global standard of commons structure and governance as well as more efficient mechanisms for DERs. 
- **domain simulations** - energy and grid-related sims (NREL [dGen](https://github.com/Plurigrid/dgen))
- **open game simulation** - open games (cybercat), agent-based simulation aka token engineering (Tokenspice) - how do tokens contribute to creation of commons / incentives and direct behavior
- **infrastructure simulation** - (data availability, execution, consensus layers of replicated state machines) + message relaying infrastructure for communication between them + physical sensors and interfaces + MPC for private ML
- **agent-based simulation** (incl. adversary simulation) - can use TokenSpice, [[../Technology/cadCAD]]

## What on üåè is Plurigrid? 
It's in your head.
## What is our dystopia?
When creating anything with optimistic, or radically optimistic ~= utopian aspirations, it is informative to consider a dystopia of where you might end up if not attentive to unintended consequences.  For instance, for PG, it's [THX 1138](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHgqfVQWv7s). The dystopia where our assumption of human nature as one that strives for better lives falls through, leading to _vampiric tyrrany_.

## Karl Popper Criterion
If Plugrid were to be any of the onchain entities or technologies associated with it, and since the current most significant onchain entity is arguably its [DAO on Jun√∏](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1z3zqgz7t0hcu2fx4wusuyjq0gc2m33la8l64saunfz7vmqwa2d5sz6jnep) - then since
