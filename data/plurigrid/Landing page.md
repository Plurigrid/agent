It's crucial for the operation to have a clear standpoint that addresses a clear problem, which [[../../../../World/Organizations/Plurigrid]] will be the sword that 'smart people' will wield against the energy coordination problem. Also, it will be the structural guard for some conception of public good.

UBI of clean energy
Solving energy problems in real-time with local connectedness. Interchain protocols [[../../Technology/MiniJuvix]] to ensure a resistant grid structure

Basic human right to energy: refrigeration, heating, integration to the world
Hardwired ethos, transparent structure with frictionless settlement layer to ensure [[../../Theory/pluralism]].

Metaphor to an FPGA of energy grid systems. Dynamism and mutability. 


Microgrid system modeling and simulation on timescales of electromagnetic transients. The microgrid holds up a mirror to real energy demands and dynamically optimise for steady-state behavior and sovereign governance backed by humans' natural right to energy. 

Microgrid evaluation platform, which allows utilities to connect their microgrids and run a variety of simulations.
