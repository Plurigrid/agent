The profiteers of this age promise digital freedom through technology. This is not the first such promise.

Web 1.0 promised a new horizon of digital space: open, transparent, co-created, and interoperable. In many ways, it delivered, laying the foundation for the foundational protocols, shared standards, and open licenses that make the Internet we know possible. And yet, inaccessible to most

Moxie Marlinspike, creator of Signal, [claims](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html) that centralization emerged because of two primary reasons. First, “people don’t want to run their own servers, and never will”. Second, “a protocol moves much more slowly than a platform .. if something is truly decentralized it becomes very difficult to change.” Marlinspike found that “Metamask needs to interact with the blockchain, but the blockchain has been built such that clients like MetaMask can’t interact with it. So like my dApp, Metamask accomplishes this by making API calls to three companies that have consolidated in this space”; he concludes that Ethereum has “been built with many of the same implicit trappings as web1”, and that “we should expect this kind of platform consolidation to happen”. He calls for “systems that can distribute trust [via cryptography] without having to distribute infrastructure”, and to “reduce the burden of building software”.

 and publicly underfunded, Web 1.0’s growth brought with it fracturing and commercialization.

Web 2.0 began with its own aspiration to democratization: proliferating personal websites, distributed network effects, and utopian dreams of global communication.

The growth of the blogosphere, open photo sharing, forums, and discussion spaces heralded great hopes about the democratization potential of the new web. Returning to documents like Tim O’Reilly’s 2005 ‘[What is Web2.0](https://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html?page=2)’ is eerily reminiscent of recent discourse. For example: “BitTorrent thus demonstrates a key Web 2.0 principle: _automatically gets better the more people use it_. While Akamai must add servers to improve service, every BitTorrent consumer brings his own resources to the party. There's an implicit "architecture of participation", a built-in ethic of cooperation, cooperation, in which the service acts primarily as an intelligent connecting the edges to each other and harnessing the power of the users themselves.”

 These dreams did come to pass; connectedness flourished. And yet, this success was achieved through centralized platform ownership and the building of walled gardens that now dictate the terms of online life.

And now there are new dreams. The Metaverse, championed by Facebook (now Meta Platforms, Inc.) and their peers, allows and celebrates monopoly of digital space, taking what was once collective

While a collective approach may take on various forms, at its center it is an approach driven by community solidarity, group ownership, and an open commons. In _Caliban and the Witch_, Silvia Federici links land privatization to a breakdown of social relationships. Discussing the transformation of agricultural structure and labor in 16th-century England following land enclosures and the loss of the commons, Federici writes that communities lost sense of their social relations – “families disintegrated, the youth left the village to join the increasing number of vagabonds or itinerant workers…while the elderly were left to fend for themselves” (72). This was in stark (and disappointing) contrast to the rich social relations that existed in the commons, where peasant solidarity and sociality thrived and women, although possessing little social power, could experience autonomy.

 and ensuring it is privatized and parcelled out to the highest bidder. Their Metaverse expands as a homogenizing monoculture

In agriculture, monoculture refers to the cultivation of a singular crop in an area. Though monocultures may be efficient, they are more susceptible to disease and pests. In _Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants_, Indigenous scholar and botanist, Robin Kimmerer, shares the story of the Three Sisters to advocate for polycultures over monocultures. Three Sisters, a gardening style of Native peoples, refers to the interdependent relationship between species of corn, squash, and beans. Although each of the species have different needs and growth patterns, they work alongside each other in a holistic ecosystem of growth. **Kimmerer imagines this harmonious agricultural system as a metaphor for intellectual and social relations: she writes that “the Three Sisters offer us a new metaphor for an emerging relationship between indigenous knowledge and Western science”, as well as functions as a model of care in which individuals use their unique gifts to “take care of each other [and] work together.” (208, ebook).**

, assimilating ecosystems

Since the acquisition of Kevin Systrom’s photo-sharing app Instagram, Meta has undertaken a series of acquisitions, totalling 24 billion dollars, including WhatsApp, Oculus, and Giphy. This set of moves has been a concerted ploy to gain monopoly over digital/social networks.

, displacing extant species

We think here of blogs, RSS feeds, community-owned forums, etc.

, and enclosing digital abundance into enforced, artificial scarcity. Allowed to grow, this proposed Metaverse will be a monoverse.

And this is not the only danger. There are responses to the Metaverse that only seek to direct its profits to chosen beneficiaries. These solutions find shelter under the too-broad umbrella of ‘Web3’ or ‘decentralization’ but are well-known harms in disguise—claiming flexibility while delivering precarity, championing freedom while delivering atomization, championing redistribution while delivering financialized returns for the few. We reject these solutions.

However, this does not mean we should not dream of open digital spaces of collective autonomy and shared ownership. In fact, we must

We call to mind Arundhati Roy: ‘Another world is not only possible, she is on her way. On a quiet day, I can hear her breathing’ (quoted in Macy 2007, 17).

. It only means that these promises are fated to remain unrealized if the structures and incentives underlying our digital ecosystem do not evolve alongside its technological foundations.

**We gather here to affirm that meaningful alternatives are possible.**

We gather to build these alternatives, to challenge the monoverse, and reach towards brighter technological futures:

Futures where we move past tired promises of “freedom from”—from established institutions, from regulation, from responsibility—and towards the shared capacity for building “freedom to”—to create, to learn, to struggle, to strengthen collective institutions, to ensure shared security

Freedom from external restraint on action is referred to as _negative freedom_. Here, we instead call for the _positive freedom_ of having the capacity, resources, and pathways to act upon individual and collective free will. As per Escobar: the pluriverse is not merely about “'expanding the range of choices' (liberal freedom) but is intended to transform the kinds of beings we desire to be”.

.

Futures of **polycentrism**

Here, we draw inspiration from Nobel-prize winner in economics Elinor Ostrom’s work in governing the commons through intentional shared rule-setting across levels of control (individual, community, neighborhood, locality, state, etc.). Ostrom, Elinor. "Beyond markets and states: polycentric governance of complex economic systems." _American Economic Review_ 100.3 (2010): 641-72.

, beyond either atomized decentralization or top-down centralization, where collective self-determination is protected through overlapping rights and responsibilities, abundant digital public infrastructure, and mechanisms for accountable governance.

Futures of **plurality**

Plurality refers to a state in which multiple alternatives co-exist. Classical pluralism in a political science context takes this and applies it to the distribution of power within a political system. As laid out by thinkers such as Robert Dahl in_Who Governs?_, political pluralism advocates for the peaceful co-existence and self-determination of multiple and layered groups within democratic contexts.

, where choice is meaningful because difference and divergence

Divergence is the process of differentiation. An end-state of difference is required for pluriversality, but so is a continuous state of divergence; without this, islands of difference can merge and become monocultures, as we have already seen with the giant platforms of the current web.

 are possible.

Futures of **regenerative scale** and **shared growth**, that combat monoculture through a stronger, broader, and more **rooted ecology of adaptation and co-evolution.**

Together, we can steward these new futures; we invite you to dream, collaborate, and strategize towards a different world. We propose to gather these worlds around a different banner: the **pluriverse, a world in which many worlds fit.**
