>Makes sense, the data diode is supposed to act as an electronic airgap in this system. It's especially brilliant to have a foam padded box; I assume it's a metal box as well to prevent both acoustic and electromagnetic data exfiltration. Haven't found a vulnerability yet but I hadn't looked long since I was heading off to sleep. Might think of one in the morning so Plurigrid can have an ultra-secure system if you decide to make these.

>There is some irony in the possibility of having such an ultra-secure micro-inverter message-passing system connected up to a home where the owner still uses 123456 for their Wi-Fi password and might change it once a year if ever. Some good end-to-end encryption will be a must. You might also think about fully homomorphic encryption as well if you need to run data analytics while leaving the information encrypted all the time.

Great work you’re doing; I’m excited to see the results of your work in 2023. Zero trust means trust no one; was just thinking about the advantage of using equipment from your home turf and very close by. Didn’t know it was actively being worked on and not a final product, so I’m sure you have plenty of improvements in mind. And yes, like all great things, homomorphisms are indeed computationally expensive. I haven’t dug very far into implementing those on systems where computational power will be a challenge - just mentioned it in case brilliant minds here like yourself and @Barton might think of some way it could be done, if it might be of use to you.

Inline Detection of Domain Generation Algorithms with Context-Sensitive Word EmbeddingsDomain generation algorithms (DGAs) are frequently employed by malware to generate domains used for connecting to command-and-control (C2) servers. Recent work in DGA detection leveraged deep learning architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and character-level long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) to classify domains. However, these classifiers perform poorly with wordlist-based DGA families, which generate domains by pseudorandomly concatenating dictionary words. We propose a novel approach that combines context-sensitive word embeddings with a simple fully-connected classifier to perform classification of domains based on word-level information. The word embeddings were pre-trained on a large unrelated corpus and left frozen during the training on domain data. The resulting small number of trainable parameters enabled extremely short training durations, while the transfer of language knowledge stored in the representations allowed for high-performing models with small training datasets. We show that this architecture reliably outperformed existing techniques on wordlist-based DGA families with just 30 DGA training examples and achieved state-of-the-art performance with around 100 DGA training examples, all while requiring an order of magnitude less time to train compared to current techniques. Of special note is the technique's performance on the matsnu DGA: the classifier attained a 89.5% detection rate with a 1:1,000 false positive rate (FPR) after training on only 30 examples of the DGA domains, and a 91.2% detection rate with a 1:10,000 FPR after 90 examples. Considering that some of these DGAs have wordlists of several hundred words, our results demonstrate that this technique does not rely on the classifier learning the DGA wordlists. Instead, the classifier is able to learn the semantic signatures of the wordlist-based DGA families.

ah, I totally get that -- I once put together an idea (~ early 2018) - let's use language models and word embeddings to detect botnet domain names, but then Joewie did all of the work :)

@Metaberk it is a great formulation and approach though -- especially simulation showing that players quickly discover the equilibrium given game mechanism guidance (that concave property is also applicable to payments processor in Inverter Network's Protocol):
"...players place their assets into a pool which then pays out some concave
function of all assets placed into it. Each player then receives a pro-rata share of the
payout; i.e., each player receives an amount proportional to how much they placed
in the pool. Such games appear in a number of practical scenarios, including as a
simplified version of certain batched decentralized exchanges, such as those proposed by
Penumbra. We show that this game has a number of interesting properties, including
a symmetric pure equilibrium that is the unique equilibrium of this game"

Had to read a bit to see why non-cooperative game theory (NCGT) was more applicable here than CGT. I saw the explanation at the end here: https://blockchain-academy.hs-mittweida.de/courses/game-theory-blockchain/lessons/basics-of-game-theory/topic/cooperative-vs-non-cooperative-game-theory/. Probably need to read the rest to figure out why, if there is a goal of reaching optimal power production and storage regardless of how many players exist, that binding agreements characteristic of CGT would not work. After all, a smart contract enables transactions to occur that seem to be binding agreements between players. Anyhow, this appears to be a great resource regarding game theory and blockchain: https://blockchain-academy.hs-mittweida.de/courses/game-theory-blockchain/. Some good sections on social choice and network effects as well.

1:50 AM



3.3.3. Implicit Coordination
In implicit coordination, prosumers do not share their personal information with a central entity nor with their peers, but may monitor their current wider information environment (e.g. wholesale prices) or utilise information about past system characteristics to inform their independent decision-making (Fig. 2). While bilateral trades are effective coordination tools, the physical reality of the electricity network only recognises injection and extraction points, with electrons flowing independently of the bilateral financial transactions the market participants agree upon. The problem of coordination thus boils down to the sum of individual decisions to import and export electricity. This case corresponds to the definition of “decentralised control” [30] wher...

However, this is an application of game theoretical treatment of energy markets at the edge -- what I envision for the Penumbra game let's call it -- to form better social contracts (hat tip to Rousseau) and enfranchise the local moneyed class along a more structured revolution -- i.e. it is not up to Plurigrid Protocol as a whole to resolve how population and their oligarchs settle disputes (to remain credibly neutral), but it's up to us to provide instantiators of each particular Plurigrid instance some options of how to configure a better game to play, e.g. in transactive energy markets
1:54 AM


Dahl Winters
Every day is a journey since I’m always learning something new. Will take a look, thanks! Already I’m seeing that game theory has some great insights for decentralized transactive energy. Users can opt in/out which changes the number of players, but the dynamics appear to remain largely the same.
1:54 AM



Barton
for instance, the proportion here could be configured: "Each player then receives a pro-rata share of the
payout; i.e., each player receives an amount proportional to how much they placed
in the pool. " or some other concavity of structured revolution
1:54 AM



so then in providing liquidity to local currency / payments / settlement mechanism, the oligarchs could both compete and cooperate in ways that individually, would lead them to experiencing agency necessary for political legitimation of redistributive process; of course, provisions will be left in protocol configuration to deal with less "willing" autocrats etc. the protocol must succeed at establishing resilient supply of Universal Based Electricity anywhere

Universal service is also the name of a fund and the category of FCC programs and policies to implement this principle. Universal service is a cornerstone of the law that established the FCC, the Communications Act of 1934. Since that time, universal service policies have helped make telephone service ubiquitous, even in remote rural areas.

Bullshark: DAG BFT Protocols Made PracticalWe present Bullshark, the first directed acyclic graph (DAG) based asynchronous Byzantine Atomic Broadcast protocol that is optimized for the common synchronous case. Like previous DAG-based BFT protocols, Bullshark requires no extra communication to achieve consensus on top of building the DAG. That is, parties can totally order the vertices of the DAG by interpreting their local view of the DAG edges. Unlike other asynchronous DAG-based protocols, Bullshark provides a practical low latency fast-path that exploits synchronous periods and deprecates the need for notoriously complex view-change mechanisms. Bullshark achieves this while maintaining all the desired properties of its predecessor DAG-Rider. Namely, it has optimal amortized communication complexity, it provides fairness and asynchronous liveness, and safety is guaranteed even under a quantum adversary. In order to show the practicality and simplicity of our approach, we also introduce a standalone partially synchronous version of Bullshark which we evaluate against the state of the art. The implemented protocol is embarrassingly simple (200 LOC on top of an existing DAG-based mempool implementation (Narwhal & Tusk). It is highly efficient, achieving for example, 125,000 transaction per second with a 2 seconds latency for a deployment of 50 parties. In the same setting the state of the art pays a steep 50% latency increase as it optimizes for asynchrony.

Weaponized power outages as means of liberating global precariat can be good)

Creating the right opportunities as a means of empowering global precariat might be even better. (Somehow, weaponizing anything for liberation sounds too much like the US in Afghanistan, even if that might be one strategy someone decides to employ as a means of helping out. And I had to look up the word precariat. I really do seem to learn something new here every day.)

But if someone does decide to cause widespread power outages on behalf of the global precariat, it will not be my first priority to complain...I'll be shutting down my computers and backup units and preparing for some nice days off.

Each pack is 24 volts and can reliably supply up to 3000 watt-hours of power (!!!) for a fraction of the price, size, and weight of comparable commercial batteries. It’s been an extremely successful project so far and has already been put to use in mobile applications around town.”

Some awesome suggestions above! I really love the community power pods and those are some awesome batteries. No generator though, since when my gas runs out I'll have to stand in line like everyone else and I know I'll be the last to get served.
3:42 AM



I had a thought a while back that if the power is off for more than a few days and you can't drive somewhere because of impassable roads or traffic from everyone else leaving, the gas trucks are also likely to be a bit delayed in getting in to provide you with refills.


Ellie
i’ll share this with the group with the following context: it’s me powering an 3000w ac step down converter from a ev charger which is powering a lil fan but can also recharge a lot of things




i got this refillable 5lb propane tank on black friday https://www.rei.com/
Ellie

if money was no object i’d get the ecoflow dual fuel (lp and gas) generator

this is cool because i can be “off grid” but then recharge a battery to power my things if solar is not working or if it’s too expensive to buy up front. i can pay like a dollar or two a day to have full charge to run ac or whatever


my car becomes a roaming micro grid :p

i had an idea for a product that would give end users a micro grid (before i used the term) on a lil trailer and they could use it as a battery back up under the condition they would have it feed back to the grid if needed but also be available on a grid sharing network for people that wanted to rent the micro grid trailer

SkyH2O – Atmospheric Water Generation
skyh2o.com
@Case this is an awesome video! Here's a related company removing water from air: https://skyh2o.com/
I spent a lot of time a while back gaining a lot of hands-on electrical and chemical engineering knowledge. Figured I'd learn how not to shock/burn/blow myself up to save myself from getting stabbed/shot/beaten up by folks who will get their LPG long before me if the power were out for more than a week or so.
But the best value is in being able to see emergency power generation everywhere. And if you have a water well and need to power it, it is empowering to be able to do so.
I love the aluminum-air batteries. Everyone has access to aluminum.


Ellie

wen autonomous EVs poweeed by renewables that deliver potable water from abundant sources to less abundant sources and bring back needed resources from the place that has what the water rich place needs


Dahl Winters

Quick clarification in case there's a question, aluminum-air batteries aren't rechargeable. But there's lots of different battery types. You can even make batteries out of soup cans. If you had to, of course. Lithium batteries are much easier to come by and obviously there are electric cars to help with things.

Ellie

personally a fan of potato power

Dahl Winters

Energy density is why everyone goes for lithium. Potatoes (and pickles and hot dogs) store energy only by virtue of serving as an electrolyte that conducts current. The voltage really comes from the dissimilar metals being used as electrodes. As long as there's two different metals and something in between to conduct electricity, you can have a battery.

Dahl Winters

I try...lots of great things I learn here as well so occasionally I try to give something back.

@Case I still haven't see you on the video but I haven't watched the last half yet. Loved seeing the solar panels though

Dahl Winters

Will keep the video confidential as requested. Sad that such a great development is too political to be shared. Even sadder to me that we have the system of water rights that we do. I can imagine how well it would go for my personal existence if every cell from my heart to my brain demanded payment just to get blood circulating there. It has to flow there anyway for the benefit of the whole body, including the heart. Some things I'm still left scratching my head over.

Case

Thanks! It was so tough to get in there, too. We talked about setting up POS validators on the reservation - but there's a lot involved. 1-2 years of planning and you can get to the central council. The person in the video grew up on the land and came back to help. There aren't people helping.

Land Use Trade-offs in Decarbonization of Electricity Generation in the American WestLand-use conflicts may constrain the unprecedented rates of renewable energy deployment required to meet the decarbonization goals of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This paper employs geospatially resolved data and a detailed electricity system capacity expansion model to generate 160 affordable, zero-carbon electricity supply portfolios for the American west and evaluates the land use impacts of each portfolio. Less than 4% of all sites suitable for solar development and 17% of all wind sites appear in this set of portfolios. Of these sites, 53% of solar and 85% of wind sites exhibit higher development risk and potential for land use conflict. We thus find that clean electricity goals cannot be achieved in an affordable manner without substantial renewable development on sites with potential for land use conflict. However, this paper identifies significant flexibility across western U.S. states to site renewable energy or alter the composition of the electricity supply portfolio to ameliorate potential conflicts.

Yeah I was surprised that the anoma people had almost derived much of Stirling’s work in the protocol without having read the book lol

Zargham

jahed

i am less surprised. although i think Stirlings work is important and relevant here. I think it follows quite obviously from basic network science / networked games extensions applied to the social choice literature (eg Rawls). That is not to diminish it; its just a line of reasoning and construction that is sufficiently natural given the extant literature or related topics that most well informed research teams would produce something pretty similar.


Zargham

generally this is a good sign -- i think networked view of social choice their are super important as they unlock our capacity to understand more "real" social choice problems which necessarily have spatial heterogenaity.


Zargham

its not "consensus" in the sense of consensus decision making in governance -- but consensus in the sense of convergence toward an equilibrium in a spatially distributed system

if one were to take this track towards a social choice theory you would swap out the "average" for a Rawlsian Max-Min and explore how the coordination protocols needed to chain to achieve such a coordinated objective. I view this as a nice way to approach development of decentralized protocols for resource sharing the skew towards improving the conditions for the worst off versus continuing to reward those with the most. Definitely something i'd like to further explore on the whiteboard next time you are around the albany extitute @Barton.

Categorical Foundations of Gradient-Based LearningWe propose a categorical semantics of gradient-based machine learning algorithms in terms of lenses, parametrised maps, and reverse derivative categories. This foundation provides a powerful explanatory and unifying framework: it encompasses a variety of gradient descent algorithms such as ADAM, AdaGrad, and Nesterov momentum, as well as a variety of loss functions such as as MSE and Softmax cross-entropy, shedding new light on their similarities and differences. Our approach to gradient-based learning has examples generalising beyond the familiar continuous domains (modelled in categories of smooth maps) and can be realized in the discrete setting of boolean circuits. Finally, we demonstrate the practical significance of our framework with an implementation in Python.
arxiv.org
Since this mentioned Nesterov, wanted to resurface this categorical treatment https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01931



Parametric lens

TL;DR on instrumental applicability: "Our approach to gradient-based learning has examples generalising beyond the familiar continuous domains (modelled in categories of smooth maps) and can be realized in the discrete setting of boolean circuits."

Implication being that if the social choice optimization problem is not in the continuous domain, i.e. an aggregation of validity predicates about grid states or some discrete preference expression, there is still hope; there is any number of impossibility results in social choice theory though, so I am only cautiously optimistic

Plurigrid is fundamentally a pro-growth movement -- there is no turning back! That being said, sustainable growth is longer term more effective; we strive for energy mix pluralism and on a personal level, I think many climate activists are too negative on nuclear

www.sciencedirect.com
This paper hits at the core of Plurigrid's thesis -- that decentralized energy can allow for the most action spaces to reach the required coordination potential / disintermediate the entities that corrupt signal; that mutual credit & obligation clearing tied to intent matching based on energy as the universal medium of exchange will over time replace MMT and money as we know it; that validity predicates & equilibria-seeking open games w/ agency can allow for a degree of assurance in our systems to counteract the so-called "social traps" that the paper calls out!


In a very real sense, I think this is the single most important paper for the group to read, and we will hold a Twitter Space breaking it down in the very near future!

A most beautiful paper for me to wake up to today. Glad to finally see a journal article addressing the global superorganism at a systems level. It’s been something I’ve thought about for years. Hopefully the important work of proving people with the means of synchronizing all these systems can get done here. Which can get accomplished through coordination. And optimization toward metrics that lead to greater system function rather than local function (i.e. in support of a few people who aim to be financially rich at the expense of everyone else).

Important work indeed, but in my experience no investor wanted to fund such work. But there are always other avenues to success…

The configuration of the household to be able to operate in the so-called "islanding" mode is actually quite good for the grid flexibility, allowing the users to disconnect during anomaly events etc.


Who needs it most are the edge resources around the so-called developing world -- and decentralized funding models are welcome for development of regions that would otherwise not receive any institutional investors, e.g. https://www.microgridknowledge.com/x-sub-features/article/11427212/husk-power-systems-sets-goal-to-build-500-microgrids-in-nigeria-by-2026

for sure! not mean at all by the way, these are great questions! at the end of the day this succeeds by forming partnerships with actual physical boots on the ground companies doing installations, manufacturing microinverters, working with governments on energy derivatives etc.

it is a very common assumption that Plurigrid's aim is to do the whole thing (tm), whereas in actuality we are laser-focused on two things:
- *interoperability* for all transactive energy market participants, especially those working on mechanism design - this is where gridIBC (IBC but operating over relayers / various validator and availability sampling nodes that interface w/ various regionally specific governmental and corporate entities, striving for assurance that they do not cheat)
- *digital public goods* like datasets, models, and indeed open-source Julia tooling (making sure that sustainable funding models are available even if the university or UN entity etc cannot fund them anymore)

all while maintaining choice and neutrality. beyond these, the rest absolutely _must_ come from partnerships and existing entities implementing Plurigrid Protocol



An all-Africa dataset of energy model “supply regions” for solar photovoltaic and wind power - Scientific DataWith solar and wind power generation reaching unprecedented growth rates globally, much research effort has recently gone into a comprehensive mapping of the worldwide potential of these variable renewable electricity (VRE) sources. From a perspective of energy systems analysis, the locations with the strongest resources may not necessarily be the best candidates for investment in new power plants, since the distance from existing grid and road infrastructures and the temporal variability of power generation also matter. To inform energy planning and policymaking, cost-optimisation models for energy systems must be fed with adequate data on potential sites for VRE plants, including costs reflective of resource strength, grid expansion needs and full hourly generation profiles. Such data, tailored to energy system models, has been lacking up to now. In this study, we present a new open-source and open-access all-Africa dataset of “supply regions” for solar photovoltaic and onshore wind power to feed energy models and inform capacity expansion planning.

What attracts the needed people to a new city has always struck me as one hell of an endogenous Gordian knot... Interesting persistence studies in economic history suggest serious limits as to the ability to plan what is more of the emergence from the aggregation of many many individual decisions across space and time.

Most of the new cities seem to advertise governance benefits, but those expected benefits to individual residents have to overcome the massive costs of moving geospatially, not to mention the comparative uncertainty that such ventures present both on economic and governance margins.

I think more specialized smaller communities offer far more promise than the startup mega-cities mentality, especially in ossified jurisdictions/economies like the United States.


Dahl Winters

$0.02: there might be too many cities already...many abandoned places and portions of cities that deteriorate because people move elsewhere. Easier to create something new than to clean up existing messes (i.e. like carbon emissions). Houston has learned from Finland how to solve its homeless problem. Not at all difficult if people are willing. I'm amazed this hasn't happened in California yet to my knowledge. https://www.positive.news/society/the-surprisingly-simple-solution-to-homelessness-thats-getting-results/

If you notice, SubmitPower and SubmitEstimate are left fallow in this particular implementation; neither is there a CosmWasm -- it is a Celestia Rollmint chain, however
11:01 AM



Rollmint is an ABCI (Application Blockchain Interface) implementation for sovereign rollups to deploy on top of Celestia.

It is built by replacing Tendermint, the Cosmos-SDK consensus layer, with a drop-in replacement that communicates directly with Celestia's Data Availability layer.

It spins up a sovereign rollup, which collects transactions into blocks and posts them onto Celestia for consensus and data availability.

The goal of Rollmint is to enable anyone to design and deploy a sovereign rollup on Celestia in minutes.

Furthermore, while Rollmint allows you to build sovereign rollups on Celestia, it currently does not support fraud proofs yet and is therefore running in "pessimistic" mode, where nodes would need to re-execute the transactions to check the validity of the chain (i.e. a full node). Furthermore, Rollmint currently only supports a single sequencer.
11:02 AM



TL;DR Plurigrid is a Pessimistic Rollup
11:02 AM



testnet #0 is not the end of the story, however
11:02 AM



(Pessimistic Rollup = nodes would need to re-execute the transactions to check the validity of the chain)
11:03 AM



testnet #1: Marie Curie will be the execution layer that will talk to testnet #0: Edith Clark using IBC over gridIBC

Marie Curie is a wasmd 0.30 chain and can calculate rewards to Estimate submitters based on the actual Power observed (these can be batched submissions to Pessimistic Rollup using IoTaWatt, say, every hour https://docs.iotawatt.com/en/master/)

What is a Computational Receipt? | RISC ZeroWhen a method executes inside the RISC Zero zkVM, the zkVM produces a computational receipt along with the output.
www.risczero.com
more generally, in future testnets, ProofOfCommitment is going to proceed by enabling the Data Availability Sampling with custom Proof pathways that will be specific to application -- in this case, using Pessimistic Rollup approach

we avoid the need for Fraud Proofs; of course, future updates will show formal verification for running Rust code privately (in zkVM) for posting correct values of Proof and Estimate, another big evolution in our roadmap. https://www.risczero.com/docs/explainers/proof-system/



Barton

When a piece of code runs on a machine, the execution trace is a complete record of the computation: a snapshot of the full state of the machine at each clock cycle of the computation.

It's typical to write an execution trace as a rectangular array, where each row shows the complete state of the machine at a given moment in time, and each column shows a temporal record of some particular aspect of the computation (say, the value stored in a particular RISC-V register) at each clock cycle. A line-by-line analysis of the trace allows for a computational audit with respect to the program instructions and the underlying computer architecture.



Constructing a Seal | RISC ZeroThe seal is the part of the receipt that allows third-parties to authenticate the validity of the journal. It's the zero-knowledge proof that sits at the crux of our technology, showing that the journal was faithfully constructed (according to the program defined by the methodID).

But, TL;DR: https://github.com/Plurigrid/grid


Estimate submission for any given hour's Power output can proceed either from simulating the grid in a microworld locally, by using MPC training w/ private inputs and running more interesting models centrally etc.



Simulation using edge implicit / local module -- in this case rewarding the authors of the module can be one of the ways to bootstrap the simulation economy

simulation using gridSPICE can take into consideration other participants, incentives that exist etc. by using cw-orchestrate together with .wasm of any performance-based smart incentives, e.g. by simulating the grid-contracts incentives observed on testnet #1: Marie Curie

and the first approximation of the modular architecture, for the Pessimistic Rollup scenario, and how hourly reward can be calculated; by normalizing Power and Estimates, a (small, though by no means sufficient) measure of privacy is obtained

(estimate will be rewarded based on 0..1 where 0 is completely off and 1 completely correct)

Some of the design constraints for future cities will be literally brutal in terms of the population they need to sustain and the resources they have to do so. The socialist hate for ornamentation derived from their belief that such aesthetic flourishes came at the cost of devoting such resources to the poor. Whether chosen for ideological reasons is the right path to brutalism, many of the margins by which aesthetics could still receive treatment hold important lessons for making our future brutalist modular megalopolises humane on the few margins and extent to which that is possible. The spomenik monuments in the former Yugoslav republics to me are an important testament of the ability of the human spirit to flourish even amidst altogether literally and politically brutalist conditions.

Information thermodynamics bridges information theory and statistical physics by connecting information content and entropy production through measurement and feedback control. Maxwell’s demon is a hypothetical character that uses information about a system to reduce its entropy. Here we realize a Maxwell’s demon acting on a superconducting quantum circuit. We implement quantum non-demolition projective measurement and feedback operation of a qubit and verify the generalized integral fluctuation theorem. We also evaluate the conversion efficiency from information gain to work in the feedback protocol.

"Equium claims that the heat pump system is completely silent, despite the use of a speaker to generate the acoustic wave. The level of noise is reportedly lower than 30 dB – the equivalent of a whisper.

“The sound our system produces stays confined inside the core, so you cannot hear it from outside,” said Loyer.

Unionized Data Governance in Virtual Power PlantsFlexible electricity networks continuously coordinate and optimize operations through ICT systems. An overlay data grid conveys information about the state of the electricity grid, as well as the status of demand and production of electricity in households and industry. Data is thus the basis for decisions that affect electricity costs and availability of assets on the electricity grid. It is crucial that these decisions are formed and monitored according to a well-defined governance model. No such data governance model exists today. In this paper, we focus on the central role of virtual power plants in flexible electricity networks. We define the problem of data governance in a virtual power plant, insisting on the issues linked to the inherent asymmetry of this system. We propose unionization as a framing device to reason about this issue. The central contribution of this paper is thus principles for a unionized data governance model for virtual power plants.

Widening Highways Doesn’t Fix Traffic. So Why Do We Keep Doing It?With billions of dollars available to improve transportation infrastructure, states have a chance to try new strategies for addressing congestion. But some habits are hard to break.

The most recent transformation of world order is often depicted as a shift from a Westphalian to a post-Westphalian era in which international organizations are becoming increasingly independent sites of authority. This internationalization of authority is often considered as an indication of the constitutionalization of the global legal order. However, this article highlights that international organizations can also exercise authority in an authoritarian fashion that violates the same constitutionalist principles of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law that international organizations are usually expected to promote. It is thus an open question which post-Westphalia we are in fact heading to: a constitutionalized order, an authoritarian order, or a combination of both? Based on a conceptualization of post-Westphalian orders as a two-dimensional continuum linking the ideal-typical end points of constitutionalism and authoritarianism, we analyze the United Nations security system and the European Union economic system as two post-Westphalian orders. While we find a remarkable level of constitutionalization in the European Union and incipient constitutionalist tendencies in the United Nations, we also find authoritarian sub-orders in both institutions. Most visibly, the latter can be discerned in the United Nations Security Council’s counter-terrorism policy after 9/11 and European emergency governance during the sovereign debt crisis. The article thus argues that the emerging post-Westphalian order is characterized by a plurality of fundamentally contradictory (sub-)orders coexisting in parallel.

The individuals in them will always seek to. "Anarchy is not a social form, but a method of individualization. No society will concede to me more than a limited freedom and a well-being that it grants to each of its members. But I am not content with this and want more. I want all that I have the power to conquer. Every society seeks to confine me to the august limits of the permitted and the prohibited. But I do not acknowledge these limits, for nothing is forbidden and all is permitted to those who have the force and the valor. Consequently, anarchy, which is the natural liberty of the individual freed from the odious yoke of spiritual and material rulers, is not the construction of a new and suffocating society. It is a decisive fight against all societies-christian, democratic, socialist, communist, etc, etc. Anarchism is the eternal struggle of a small minority of aristocratic outsiders against all societies which follow one another on the stage of history.

generating soulful ChatGPT e-gen copy for Plurality Institute is actually phun -- if you are around, and not at capacity for more chaos energy, do come to my soapbox:

A decentralized, pluralistic, and interoperable energy protocol would likely have a positive impact on the planet by enabling a transition to a more sustainable and efficient energy system. Such a protocol would allow for greater flexibility in the generation and distribution of energy, as well as improved resilience in the face of disruptions. Additionally, it could also enable greater participation and ownership in the energy system by individuals and communities.

To understand the specific impact of a decentralized energy protocol, it would be important to gain clarification on the following:

The Internet TransitionThe Internet is allowing us to build a richer, more complex society but the way in which we Internet today is failing to support the governance systems that a more complex world requires. I take a look at why these issues are related, try to develop an intuition for a way forward, and point at the emerging field that is coming together to build that future.

Outside of any meta considerations of a distant future

, the role of Plurigrid Protocol is to:
- create reliable systems of record for aggregated choice and availability of performance data
- provide verifiable performance-based incentives and other mechanisms for resource allocation and unit commitments
- ensure interoperability for coordination infrastructure and privacy-preserving approaches to capacity / demand modeling are economically viable outside of the current systems of surveillance capitalism

* provide deterministic execution for verifiable performance-based incentives -- CosmWasm, EVM etc need to work with many open and pluralistic options :)

Unit commitment problem in electrical power production - Wikipedia

In order to make decentralization and edge development viable, we also need to extend the utility -friendly CCA to include sustainable funding modes through mutual credit inspired approaches that are coming to be known as "Collaborative Finance" but simply put, treating networks of value exchange along energy and obligation graph for its future generation (an obligation becomes ≈ commitment as in https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_commitment_problem_in_electrical_power_production but over greater timescale, and with value-aligned communities that absorb the risk as a network)

PV-AC-DC | Electricity | 2022 | ATB | NREL
atb.nrel.gov
Capacity factor is the ratio of the annual average energy production (kWhAC) of an energy generation plant divided by the theoretical maximum annual energy production of a plant assuming it operates at its peak rated capacity every hour of the year.

For a PV system, the rated capacity in the denominator is either reported in terms of the aggregated capacity of (1) all its modules or (2) all its inverters. PV modules are rated using standard test conditions and produce direct current (DC) energy; inverters convert DC energy/power to alternating current (AC) energy/power. Therefore, the capacity of a PV system is rated either in MWDC via the aggregation of all modules' rated capacities or in MWAC via the aggregation of all inverters' rated capacities. The ratio between these two capacities is referred to as the inverter loading ratio (ILR).

Machine learning conservation laws from differential equationsWe present a machine learning algorithm that discovers conservation laws from differential equations, both numerically (parametrized as neural networks) and symbolically, ensuring their functional independence (a nonlinear generalization of linear independence). Our independence module can be viewed as a nonlinear generalization of singular value decomposition. Our method can readily handle inductive biases for conservation laws. We validate it with examples including the three-body problem, the KdV equation, and nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.

I love that Barton - "thank grid it's monday" indeed!
Hadn't checked in here for a while - looks like a lot of very sad news above. Interesting how centralization occurred as a result of users adopting a technology (blockchain) meant for decentralizing a resource...

Had a thought...whether a system is centralized or decentralized at present might be expressed by the dynamic equilibrium of attractive and repulsive forces acting on the nodes of that system. Under conditions of scarcity that encourages greed, centralized systems tend to win out because each node/person is less likely to share and cooperate. Those that learn to share and cooperate are likely the products of more favorable conditions, and thus decentralized systems tend to win out because it is of less personal cost (and perha...

"One of the central tenets of cybernetics, known as Ashby’s Law after Ross Ashby, is that a system must be able to have the same level of variety as its environment in order to survive. When the environment changes from one state to another, the system must be able to change in turn; the system must be able to match the variety in the environment."

Functional, logical, and physical architectures are important tools for designing complex systems. We describe what architectures are and how they contribute to the early stages of a project. The focus of this video is on describing a system as a collection of its functions and we show how that can provide a foundation from which we can develop models and perform trade studies.

The philosopher Plato, writing in Athens in the Fourth Century BCE, uses the word ‘kybernetes,’ which refers to the act of steering a ship. Plato compares steering a ship to governing a city (in Ancient Greece there weren’t really nations or states as we understand them, and people lived in city-states, such as Athens). Our word ‘govern’ comes from this Ancient Greek word ‘kybernetes.’ In Latin the k becomes g, the y becomes u, to give us ‘gubernare.’ This is still used in speaking about matters related to the state Governors, in ‘gubernatorial elections,’ for instance.
10:01 PM



"If cybernetics has its lineage in ideas about governing a community – constituted most commonly as hierarchical systems of government – why is any of this interesting for anarchism?"
10:02 PM



"For Plato, the steering of a ship was a metaphor for how the city-state should be governed. Not through democracy but by an enlightened pilot, a philosopher king. This is the origin of the term ‘cybernetics.’"
10:02 PM



"You might be surprised then to learn that in a 1966 essay called ‘Anarchism as a Theory of Organization’ British anarchist Colin Ward wrote that “Cybernetic theory with its emphasis on self-organising systems, and speculation about the ultimate social effects of automation, leads in a similar revolutionary direction” as anarchism.2 Why did Ward see cybernetics as comparable to anarchism, to a philosophy based on “autonomous groups, spontaneous order, workers’ control, the federative principle”?3"
10:02 PM



"At the center of this connection between anarchism and cybernetics is the idea of self-organization, and while this was initially developed in the context of technical systems, it was applied to social systems as well. Through this, cybernetics gives us a framework for understanding how people can organize their lives collectively and without structural hierarchies of command.
"
10:02 PM



The aesthetics of anarchism, at least to many, involve the throwing of molotov cocktails

Anarchy is a word just as exitutional is a word. Words are used to symbolize meanings, but meanings are the products of the speaker's experiences. Such large amounts of meaning must be represented by single words. Not sure which word is better to use, since better can be defined as whatever more efficiently leads to the intended result the speaker hoped to achieve through the use of their word.

10:08 PM



Dahl Winters
People seem to develop more and more fields of knowledge develop over time, thus needing to develop different words as a result, seemingly for the purpose of achieving greater resolution of something no single person can fully resolve. We have to build networks to exchange information to make sense of that something, like how insects have compound eyes, each facet seeing something different that must be integrated to understand what is there to be seen. Am thinking we are collectively trying to resolve the details of the self-organizing system we are a part of. All material here worth my time to read more closely today.
10:14 PM



Micheal Zargham
"Anarchy" as term to encode a specific political philosophy was actively mimetically poisoned. This makes it very difficult to socialize that political philosophy; however, its so fundamental to human nature that we keep reinventing it in different varieties with different names.

Plurality of coalitions interoperating

10:27 PM



A Coalition Formation Game Approach for Personalized Federated LearningFacing the challenge of statistical diversity in client local data distribution, personalized federated learning (PFL) has become a growing research hotspot. Although the state-of-the-art methods with model similarity-based pairwise collaboration have achieved promising performance, they neglect the fact that model aggregation is essentially a collaboration process within the coalition, where the complex multiwise influences take place among clients. In this paper, we first apply Shapley value (SV) from coalition game theory into the PFL scenario. To measure the multiwise collaboration among a group of clients on the personalized learning performance, SV takes their marginal contribution to the final result as a metric. We propose a novel personalized algorithm: pFedSV, which can 1. identify each client's optimal collaborator coalition and 2. perform personalized model aggregation based on SV. Extensive experiments on various datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10) are conducted with different Non-IID data settings (Pathological and Dirichlet). The results show that pFedSV can achieve superior personalized accuracy for each client, compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks.

A bidding mechanism, such as a VCG auction, might be used in the power grid to allocate resources efficiently and fairly. One scenario in which this might be used is in the case of a power transmission line. The power grid operator may want to build a new transmission line to increase the capacity of the grid and improve its reliability. However, there are multiple potential routes for the transmission line, each with its own costs and benefits.

The bidding mechanism allows the grid operator to gather information about the true value of each potential route. By soliciting sealed bids from companies or other entities interested in using the transmission line, the operator can determine the highest bid, and therefore the route that is most valuable to the market. This allows the operator to make an informed decision about where to build the transmission line and avoid building it in an area where it is not needed.

Price is an important information transmission mechanism in the energy sector, as it helps to allocate resources efficiently and signal the relative scarcity of different types of energy. The bidding mechanism helps to transmit this information, so that the grid operator can make informed decisions about where to build transmission lines and other infrastructure. Additionally, by setting the price equal to the second-highest bid, the VCG auction ensures that the winner does not pay more than the true value of the resource, and that all bidders are paying their fair share of the social cost that their actions will impose on others.

To put bidding auctions in a more general context of transactive energy I can include good entry point overall in a video below, but in case you are pressed for time, here is the intuition:

In bidding on grid generation / transmission the parties providing bids choose to set the price as low as they can get away with + margins to win against other bids



in doing so they commit to delivering it and if they fail, can be sued in the court of law / penalized by municipal authorities / those operating the transmission contracts within utility setting, and face legal settlement
10:10 AM



In succeeding, they deliver the grid need at a discovered price that is likely closer to the optimal than under a single utility monopoly and moreover may stimulate innovation so as to ultimately, eventually, barring regulatory capture by other intermediaries do the thing that makes transactive energy and more liberal controls effective and desirable for electricity users:

lower the rate*

Decentralization allows for any portions of the grid that are split off to still remain operational and have less network effects, but in having a degree of inertia (in how the economic security or a VDF prevents flipping the script and changing the rules through consensus mechanism guarantees in their own right)

I think the NFT is a loaded thing that many people have negative priors about -- in itself it is a mechanism that has some properties but not others and is more nuanced than just the assets of the last run; more than anything it takes imperfect information games with implicit rules to perfect information explicit action states allowable by valid stage transitions (not guaranteed to be perfect, but already easier to model, understand and improve)

VCG auction is the first one to specifically enable messages and actions that all auctions need to have, and Dart / Flutter (a mobile app framework for utilitarian quick mobile / desktop UIs) clients to work with via exposing the "Submit Bid" buttons and text boxes that take the bid in and interact with the contact :)

driving up or down the price
10:22 AM


G
i’m not sure that thar answers my concerns unless i am misunderstanding
10:23 AM



Bartholomew Rhodes
This will also allow for construction of gridSPICE microworld environments / labs to illustrate with tooling to express precisely the set of scenarios or even simply fuzz the mechanism and then be rewarded for finding a weakness that helps us make them more robust
10:23 AM

is the bidder aware of the price?
10:23 AM



Bartholomew Rhodes
gsspmusic
is the bidder aware of the price?
I believe we will have to resort to a range of confidential auctions appropriate to the risks faced by those bidding
10:24 AM



gsspmusic
seems scammy
10:24 AM



why not operate like futures contracts?
10:25 AM


G
earn margin interest on positions
10:26 AM



Bartholomew Rhodes
right now the risks for @Janita and I doing it on testnet to develop the interfaces and initial demo are minimal, so we do it in the clear -- but ultimately a gradual relaxation of privacy and various scenarios enabled by increasingly easy to use ZK approaches and others will enter
10:26 AM


gsspmusic
again why not incentivize this all like futures!
10:27 AM



or is the goal less on price discovery and more on inflating the auction value?
10:27 AM


G
because if you control the financial intermediary why not just earn that margin interest knowing you’re netted both ways and let the market take care of price discovery
10:28 AM



Bartholomew Rhodes
gsspmusic
seems scammy
Not sure if the intent of this is to attack the character of the work or the mechanism, but I am sure you can relate to commitment here being to working out several pathways to bring auctions to environments where transactive energy does not exist now, and more broadly (despite the active need in the world toward which we are building this), this is the first mechanism in general and of course there is a range of other incentives we have in view and want to not overengineer for; in general constructive input on incentives to try is welcome as issues, and even more as PRs :)
10:28 AM



gsspmusic
again why not incentivize this all like futures!
Futures indeed have precisely the placement within commitments
10:29 AM



On capacity and demand
10:29 AM



And being able to run confidential computations, like day ahead predictions, on more home data is useful for better models
10:30 AM



gsspmusic
well they are intended as a hedge on risk
10:30 AM



and that seems like that is the value here, connecting risk-seeking with risk-avoidant investors
10:30 AM



like why the auctiok model and not long/short derivatives?
10:31 AM


G
esp. with energy i’m just not sure i understand
10:32 AM



Bartholomew Rhodes
we emphasize interoperability of many mechanisms including those develop elsewhere and see this as a way to maximize action spaces / trajectories explored by other (increasingly numerous) mechanism developing orgs and projects
10:32 AM



Bartholomew Rhodes
our emphasis on privacy is also not only something we value as a human right, but a necessity for some of those confidential computation at the edge to happen in the first place as we will need to illustrate that this does not centralize data or suffer from flaws in weaker distributed training approaches
10:33 AM




Bartholomew Rhodes
so by that token, the mechanism here is only the very first one, humbly expecting to pave ways to the orchestra of derivatives, predictable commitments to demand through placement of PoW nodes that happen to also secure more flexible execution layers from long range attacks, in fact many many more that we hope to develop into decentralized energy incentive taxonomy and legitimate / explain within the ontology from semantic web type approach where we can relate their value to the many
10:36 AM



Bartholomew Rhodes
More than anything having this interoperable energy mechanism standard and protocol guaranteeing its sustainable is the game -- so seen in context, it is not the claim at all here that VCG is the end game and is the ultimate auction to solve all things
10:37 AM



Bartholomew Rhodes
No, on the contrary, by using IBC and Actor model with message passing the claim that a universal enough foundation for experimentation, refinement, and ultimately iteration on IRL grid on which many mechanisms can be built and others integrated - that the resulting mix of choices that can be done by many instances of Plurigrids - will then successfully optimize for new grid expansion and its system properties
10:39 AM


Bartholomew Rhodes
and that the ability to engage in coalition formation that will have alignment on the basis of social choice and confidential collective bargaining with transmission, ministries of energy, or really any communication distortion and monopoly on violence enabled self-serving existing entities that refuse to see cooperative games as better -- we will eventually have enough in the way of market share and relevance to indeed have a significantly better energy futures that are also more reliable than the existing highly volatile and signal-distorting intermediaries today
10:42 AM




Bartholomew Rhodes
*energy future implementations backed by various commitments whose risk and historic behavior are reliably transmitted using systems of record with practical functional resilience to corruption particular to that region literally anywhere
10:44 AM



Bartholomew Rhodes
The answer may be VRGDA for some Plurigrids, others may benefit from the replacement of funding models with structured things like ABCs or even networked absorption of risk under some mutual credit type funding and financial access broadening instrument, yet others will benefit from Data Unions, educational DAOs, or ZK unions and other labor instruments for electricians
10:46 AM



Bartholomew Rhodes
To where the impact of strike can be derisked by formally verifying its responsible but effective use of striking by people yet continued acceptable utility of the electricity availability itself
10:46 AM



Bartholomew Rhodes
So when we build and say we focus on interoperability, we mean it -- the current focus (about which, admittedly, there can be more clarity) is to build a foundation for sustainable expansion of primitives as digital public goods and their refinement
and usability by those actually looking to execute Interoperable smart asset / renewable incentives in a reliable manner, configurable by constituencies through structured delegation and rank ordering of outcomes from simulating their impact)

the real story about the https://github.com/Plurigrid/vcg-auction repo is not the mechanism (although I do legitimately welcome engagement around its robustness or really any engagement even if an occasional gm or an emoji reaction from those lurking)

-- the real story is CosmWasm contract instance that results from it, how blockspace sovereignty can lower the cost of securing integrity, and how IBC can allow for network effects to ultimately emerge around a more fair way of scaling our agency as users of electricity
10:53 AM



Bartholomew Rhodes
And the concrete guarantor of agency is the admin on the contract instance - is it a DAO using a tokenized governance model or one using some variation of so-called "pluralistic" voting, a weighted multisig, or some NFT derived power? All are valid choices and up to sovereign decisions if we the people

One thing the admin is not is a shift operator one paycheck away from losing their home, or a CCA IT person who knows how and does anything CISO tells them, or an oligarch in parliament, or some CCP-established militarized junta

What eventual incentives that work will only be apparent in retrospect, our goal is to ensure that those along the way who will have worked on transactive energy market design and microgrid tech for many eons are not overwhelmed by this complexity and can mix and match grid designs and have ways of exposing game mechanisms at a lower price point to many devices via https://flutterflow.io)
11:07 AM



Bartholomew Rhodes
And that whatever they design in deployment is sustainable to scale and operate that leaves configurable region and scenario appropriate mechanisms to make cheating very hard (ultimately by applying the standards of industrial assurance to our amplified preferences in energy mix and whether to emphasize rate or carbon footprint etc at all levels)
11:09 AM

Bartholomew Rhodes
So if VCG does not fit the situation, and previous modeling on private inputs suggests VRGDA does better, you simply drag the other one from auctions sections; or if the strategy calls for installing more storage, you can instead include renewable potential or time of day incentive as simply as the other and be in the real world with Android, iPhone etc at lowest possible overhead and trust (established by successive iteration on interoperability and privacy primitives) in Plurigrid's ensuring the faithful execution of your intended incentive without being a modeling or blockchain expert
11:12 AM


Bartholomew Rhodes
The plurality of Plurigrids in fact, where ownership in one by the body politik / peosumers / e-gens should allow the fair allocation of upside that results from trading with other coalitions and the network effects of interoperability and proof / privacy guarantees allowing for the revenue from p2p trading to arrive without nearly corruption by intermediaries (over time), and the upside from that -- sometimes even negative rates -- to flow directly to those now reliably enfranchised into their electricity grids value in the world, and their <battery / PV panel's / garage reactor's place in it>
11:16 AM



Bartholomew Rhodes
And the implicit coordination that results from known edge or proofs / attestations of the configs of strategy profiles at each to allow for edge decisioning that derives a sound foundation for that energy commitment not from IEEE 1547 but now a way more formal guarantees whose strategy profiles implicitly do the effective thing after successive iteration on simulated and real perturbations and available to anyone who chooses to participate in the commons, not through the wishful thought or subsidies, but sustainable networks of ownership, value, and security that come from $GRID
11:20 AM



Bartholomew Rhodes
TL;DR frfr It is not one mechanism or new set of rules of engagement that will do this, but we need to start with one end-to-end decentralized expansion planning example to then iterate -- so hope it addresses the "yes, and" to the VCG auction not being quite the cure to all grid's ills :) Gotta switch gears now, but thank you for your earnest examination of the efficacy and overall interest @gsspmusic -- will credit you in the blogpost this will eventually become when the demo is complete and roadmap of how to grow it to the vision supporting any approach anyone is willing to make interoperable with Plurigrids everywhere :)

Wow, many messages. About 80 it appears. Some observations in the spirit of improving efficiency so we can reach our desired goal faster of seeing Plurigrid widely adopted:

When there are only questions and comments without useful alternatives, papers, or code to be shared, those putting in time and effort in developing Plurigrid may be more efficiently served by having such questions answered through Zulip, where answers can be provided in a more organized and searchable form.

This is because the efficiency of any information exchange is maximized by using the least information, energy, and time to achieve the desired result for which the exchange was even considered in the first place.

'Generative CI' through Collective Response SystemsHow can many people (who may disagree) come together to answer a question or make a decision? "Collective response systems" are a type of generative collective intelligence (CI) facilitation process meant to address this challenge. They enable a form of "generative voting", where both the votes, and the choices of what to vote on, are provided by the group. Such systems overcome the traditional limitations of polling, town halls, standard voting, referendums, etc. The generative CI outputs of collective response systems can also be chained together into iterative "collective dialogues", analogously to some kinds of generative AI. Technical advances across domains including recommender systems, language models, and human-computer interaction have led to the development of innovative and scalable collective response systems. For example, Polis has been used around the world to support policy-making at different levels of government, and Remesh has been used by the UN to understand the challenges and needs of ordinary people across war-torn countries. This paper aims to develop a shared language by defining the structure, processes, properties, and principles of such systems. Collective response systems allow non-confrontational exploration of divisive issues, help identify common ground, and elicit insights from those closest to the issues. As a result, they can help overcome gridlock around conflict and governance challenges, increase trust, and develop mandates. Continued progress toward their development and adoption could help revitalize democracies, reimagine corporate governance, transform conflict, and govern powerful AI systems -- both as a complement to deeper deliberative democratic processes and as an option where deeper processes are not applicable or possible.

The availability of computational power, and a wealth of data from sensors have boosted the development of model-based predictive control for smart and effective control of advanced buildings in the last decade. More recently occupant-behavior models have been developed for including people in the building control loops. However, while important objectives of scientific research are reproducibility and replicability of results, not all information is available from published documents. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a guideline for a thorough and standardized occupant-behavior model documentation. For that purpose, the literature screening for the existing occupant behavior models in building control was conducted, and the occupant behavior modeling processes were studied t... Read more
