Plurigrid is a platform that helps build more reliable and resilient electricity grids. It uses a combination of public goods, microgrids, incentive models and cyberphysical systems to create a more pluralistic alternative to central grid planning. It allows people to join the e-gen movement, schedule demos and become e-gens. The platform also provides open hardware and infrastructure, power-ups and research initiatives to help people make better decisions when it comes to electricity use.
