# Challenge
The Metaverse vision is one of total surveillance and digital control. The more data is tracked, the more one's identity is revealed, and that "person" becomes monetized potential for large platforms. In turn, people's digital identities become fodder for centrally-held AI models and algorithmically-driven engagement forecasts. This vision eschews basic rights to free expression, diversity of interactions between diverse identities, and for safety -- all of which necessarily requires privacy. Yet, this fundamental right to privacy, which leads to opportunities for human freedom, has become a luxury good: with privacy-preserving technologies remaining exclusively in the vaults of those with knowledge or capital. Such technologies prevent those with protection from being included in centralised AI models, further widening the gap between those who have the right to personal privacy, and those who's digital prescence is minutely monitored and guided by centralised models.

# Possibility
We must reimagine privacy as a public good, necessary in protecting the green shoots of these transformational tendencies in a monopolized and surveilled world. Building from a foundation of [[../Technology/distributed identity]] and verification based on personhood, not either state or stake, we will reclaim the digital sphere as one in which individuals and communities can act, grow, learn, deliberate, and actualise -- free of surveillance.

What do we lose when we put energy usage and energy trading on-chain?
What _do_ we put on chain?
Why?
