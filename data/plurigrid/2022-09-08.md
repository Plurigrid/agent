# barton update
Today we are applynig to several grants for [Plurigrid](../World/Organizations/Plurigrid.md). In parallel, we are exploring ways to start [[PluriCortex]] legal entities through which to enable deal-making, legal liability shielding for members, and receive investment in a number of jurisdictions.

Additionally, we have started the work on a CRM system to manage deal flow and interactions with our potential launch partners.

As [[PluriCortex]], we will manage deployment and integration of the open source public goods that [[../World/Organizations/Plurigrid]] will develop. This will include specific regional variations, as well as enterprise software variations not of interest to public goods commuinty, and therefore will accrue value to the commercial entity both in terms of the software packages and services it provides, as well as the total amount of revenue that will come from helping new renewable energy resources and any community who chooses to join [[../World/Organizations/Plurigrid]] to do so with the minimum amount of pain and friction, cost-effectively.
