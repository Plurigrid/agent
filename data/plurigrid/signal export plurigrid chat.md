The most recent transformation of world order is often depicted as a shift from a Westphalian to a post-Westphalian era in which international organizations are becoming increasingly independent sites of authority. This internationalization of authority is often considered as an indication of the constitutionalization of the global legal order. However, this article highlights that international organizations can also exercise authority in an authoritarian fashion that violates the same constitutionalist principles of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law that international organizations are usually expected to promote. It is thus an open question which post-Westphalia we are in fact heading to: a constitutionalized order, an authoritarian order, or a combination of both? Based on a conceptualization of post-Westphalian orders as a two-dimensional continuum linking the ideal-typical end points of constitutionalism and authoritarianism, we analyze the United Nations security system and the European Union economic system as two post-Westphalian orders. While we find a remarkable level of constitutionalization in the European Union and incipient constitutionalist tendencies in the United Nations, we also find authoritarian sub-orders in both institutions. Most visibly, the latter can be discerned in the United Nations Security Council’s counter-terrorism policy after 9/11 and European emergency governance during the sovereign debt crisis. The article thus argues that the emerging post-Westphalian order is characterized by a plurality of fundamentally contradictory (sub-)orders coexisting in parallel.

The individuals in them will always seek to. "Anarchy is not a social form, but a method of individualization. No society will concede to me more than a limited freedom and a well-being that it grants to each of its members. But I am not content with this and want more. I want all that I have the power to conquer. Every society seeks to confine me to the august limits of the permitted and the prohibited. But I do not acknowledge these limits, for nothing is forbidden and all is permitted to those who have the force and the valor. Consequently, anarchy, which is the natural liberty of the individual freed from the odious yoke of spiritual and material rulers, is not the construction of a new and suffocating society. It is a decisive fight against all societies-christian, democratic, socialist, communist, etc, etc. Anarchism is the eternal struggle of a small minority of aristocratic outsiders against all societies which follow one another on the stage of history.

generating soulful ChatGPT e-gen copy for Plurality Institute is actually phun -- if you are around, and not at capacity for more chaos energy, do come to my soapbox:

A decentralized, pluralistic, and interoperable energy protocol would likely have a positive impact on the planet by enabling a transition to a more sustainable and efficient energy system. Such a protocol would allow for greater flexibility in the generation and distribution of energy, as well as improved resilience in the face of disruptions. Additionally, it could also enable greater participation and ownership in the energy system by individuals and communities.

To understand the specific impact of a decentralized energy protocol, it would be important to gain clarification on the following:

Thanks @Andy Mac -- let's start with the one I DM'ed -- one caveat is it has to be done in an environment w/ structured diagram exporting language (think UML / Structurizr)

This is important so that with RHLF it is possible to one day to have enough examples to get "design a grid for sub-Saharan Africa where most energy sources are renewable, gas is fallback, and perturbations come from cyclical spikes in demand"

CPUC can pay for the cost of installing energy storage technology

and reliable systems of record for how incentives get allocated is one of the major benefits of using BFT ledgers
7:49 AM



Simply formalizing the process of incentive structures for those who can help discover how various incentives can connect with households, businesses, and generally DERs of all kinds may not be the most technically glamorous use-case, but can actually lead to real world impact
7:52 AM


If you know anyone in these communities or otherwise have ideas for which renewable incentives align with the need to have reliable record-keeping and structured processes around claims, please never hesitate to share them here or with gm@plurigrid.xyz

What’s particularly remarkable about Astor’s vision is the sheer detail. It was all very carefully imagined. This is a future in which “[e]lectricity in its varied forms does all work, having superseded animal and manual labour in everything, and man has only to direct.”5
11:06 PM



Everywhere, electricity is generated by the power of wind and water; the “electrical energy of every thunderstorm is also captured and condensed in our capacious storage batteries”; the “windmill and dynamo thus utilize bleak mountain-tops that, till their discovery, seemed to be but indifferent successes in Dame Nature’s domain.”6
11:06 PM



Renewable electricity is used to “run our electric ships and water-spiders, railways, and stationary and portable motors, for heating the cables laid along the bottom of our canals to prevent their freezing in winter, and for almost every conceivable purpose.”7 Everyone has a windmill on their roof.

If anyone has the answer to this question, it is this group.

I am currently looking at how UK public sector manages their energy (gas + electricity) management needs. Does anyone know of a paper or an article at hand outlining B2B customers' energy/utilities management needs/motivations or requirements in general?

An energy provider attempts to achieve 24/7 clean energyPeninsula Clean Energy, a community choice aggregator (CCA) in California, is attempting to achieve 24/7 clean energy -- clean energy that matches demand every hour of every day -- by 2025. I talk with the CEO about why they've adopted the goal and the tools they've built to achieve it.

Outside of any meta considerations of a distant future 

, the role of Plurigrid Protocol is to:
- create reliable systems of record for aggregated choice and availability of performance data
- provide verifiable performance-based incentives and other mechanisms for resource allocation and unit commitments
- ensure interoperability for coordination infrastructure and privacy-preserving approaches to capacity / demand modeling are economically viable outside of the current systems of surveillance capitalism
8:30 PM



* provide deterministic execution for verifiable performance-based incentives -- CosmWasm, EVM etc need to work with many open and pluralistic options :)

Unit commitment problem in electrical power production - Wikipedia
en.m.wikipedia.org
In order to make decentralization and edge development viable, we also need to extend the utility -friendly CCA to include sustainable funding modes through mutual credit inspired approaches that are coming to be known as "Collaborative Finance" but simply put, treating networks of value exchange along energy and obligation graph for its future generation (an obligation becomes ≈ commitment as in https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_commitment_problem_in_electrical_power_production but over greater timescale, and with value-aligned communities that absorb the risk as a network)

Lastly, there are very good indicators that if given a better game, we all can do this (also see full bibliography) -- and Plurigrid exists so that we have a protocol that ensures trajectories to finding this better games exist and bringing them about does not erode the foundations of free democratic societies (all that through the focus on interoperability, privacy, and respect for sovereign agency of the plurality of value sets worldwide, united in our their participation in the Global Commons by the universalist basis of us all requiring free energy to exist)

Theirs is a research focus, ours is that of erecting sustainable incentives and viable pluralistic decentralized alternatives that can adapt to any regionally specific conditions along every modality necessary #cybernetics

Plurigrid exists to allow for the non-experts to benefit from this and other digital public goods several times a day in ways that are effective, scalable, and ultimately have to translate to yes, into a more efficient, reliable grid and affordable electricity everywhere, but equally so, to allow for pluralistic sense-making to take place without distortion (e.g. through e-gens interacting with a microworld for their grid on their phone

and rank-ordering outcomes expressed and communicated effectively in their language, metaphors, and overall contexts)
