Pasteur Labs is a venture-backed, public-benefit corporation for building simulation intelligence technologies from theoretical foundations at TRL-1 to reliable, scalable systems at TRL-9. The name comes from "Pasteur's quadrant" for use-inspired R&D; striking the balance between 'clear problem to be solved' and 'scientific advances required', Pasteur's quadrant defines a class of R&D that calls for ambitious goals that are measurable and testable (in the real world at scale).
